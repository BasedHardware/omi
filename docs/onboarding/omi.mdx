Follow these steps to set up your Omi device:

## Step 1: Charge Your Device

Make sure your Omi device is charged. When you switch it on, there should be a light indicator.

- Turn on the device using the button in the center
- Look for the LED light to confirm it's powered on

## Step 2: Download the Omi App

Download the official Omi app from your device's app store:

- **iOS**: [Download from App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/omi-ai-smart-meeting-notes/id6502156163)
- **Android**: [Download from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.friend.ios&hl=en_US&pli=1)

You can also search for "**Omi AI**" in your respective app store.

## Step 3: Pair Your Device

1. Open the Omi app after downloading
2. Follow the in-app instructions to pair your device
3. Wait for the Bluetooth connection to establish

## Step 4: Test Transcription

After pairing, test that transcription is working:

- Speak near your Omi device
- You should see transcriptions appear in the app
- If you don't see transcriptions immediately, wait 30+ seconds
