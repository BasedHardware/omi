## Step 3: Fit and Adjust Your Glasses

Proper fit is crucial for optimal performance:

1. **Temple Adjustment**: Adjust the temple arms for comfort
2. **Nose Bridge**: Ensure glasses sit comfortably on your nose
3. **Microphone Position**: The mic should be close to your mouth
4. **Camera Angle**: Align the camera with your natural eye level

## Step 4: Pair Your Glasses

2. Power on by pressing the side button for 3 seconds
3. Open the Omi Glass app (Build 317)
4. Follow the in-app pairing instructions
5. Grant necessary permissions (camera, microphone, Bluetooth)

## Step 5: Calibration & Testing

After pairing, calibrate your glasses:

1. **Audio Calibration**: Test microphone pickup by speaking
2. **Visual Calibration**: Test camera angle and clarity
