The Omi DevKit 2 is designed for developers who want to build, test, and customize their Omi experience.

## Quick Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Power On Your DevKit" icon="power-off">
    The DevKit 2 has multiple power options:

    - **Switch method**: Use the physical switch if available on your version
    - **Button method**: Press and hold the center button for 3 seconds
    - **USB-C**: Can be powered directly via USB-C connection

    Look for the LED indicator to confirm the device is powered on.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Flash Firmware (If Needed)" icon="microchip">
    DevKits may not come with firmware pre-installed:

    1. Check if your device shows any LED activity when powered
    2. If no activity, [flash the firmware here](/doc/get_started/Flash_device)
    3. Follow the [DevKit 2 testing guide](/doc/developer/DevKit2Testing)

    <Warning>
    If you see no LED activity at all, firmware installation is required before the device will function.
