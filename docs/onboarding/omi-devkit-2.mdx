# Get Started with Omi DevKit 2

<img src="/omi-devkit-without-rope.png" alt="Omi DevKit 2" width="300" />

The Omi DevKit 2 is designed for developers who want to build, test, and customize their omi experience.

## Step 1: Power On Your DevKit

The DevKit 2 has multiple power options:

- **Switch method**: Use the physical switch if available on your version
- **Button method**: Press and hold the center button for 3 seconds
- **USB-C**: Can be powered directly via USB-C connection

Look for the LED indicator to confirm the device is powered on.

## Step 2: Development Environment Setup

Before using your DevKit, set up your development environment:

### For App Development
- Download the Omi app: [iOS App Store](https://apps.apple.com/fi/app/omi-ai-smart-meeting-notes/id6502156163) | [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.friend.ios&hl=en_US&pli=1)
- Follow our [App Development Guide](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Introduction)

### For Firmware Development
- Install the [firmware compilation tools](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/firmware/Compile_firmware)
- Set up the [development environment](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/AppSetup)

## Step 3: Flash Firmware (If Needed)

DevKits may not come with firmware pre-installed:

1. Check if your device shows any LED activity when powered
2. If no activity, [flash the firmware here](https://docs.omi.me/get_started/Flash_device/)
3. Follow the [DevKit 2 testing guide](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/DevKit2Testing)

## Step 4: Pair with App

1. Open the Omi app
2. Follow pairing instructions
3. The DevKit should appear as a discoverable device
4. Test transcription by speaking near the device

## Button Controls

### Single Press
- **Turn On/Off**: Single press to power the device on or off

### Long Press (Voice Questions)
- **Press and hold** the button until you feel a vibration
- **Keep pressed down** and ask your question
- **Release the button** when you're done speaking
- **Get your answer** in the Omi chat or as a notification on your phone

## Light Indicators
