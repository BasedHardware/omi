# Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with your Friend.

### Install the app

1. Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/friend.git`
2. Choose which version of the app you want to install (see Structure).
   - Don't have the device? run `cd apps/AppStandalone` in terminal
   - Have the device/NRF Board? run `cd apps/AppWithWearable` in terminal
3. Install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/macos/mobile-ios?tab=download) and [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)
4. Install your environment variables
   - For AppStandalone, update variables in in .env.template file
   - For AppWithWearable, you can set the api keys needed on the mobile App from the settings page itself

6. iOS: [Install XCode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) then navigate to the iOS folder. You might need to launch Xcode to select a team and specify a bundle identifier.
   Android: Download/install [android Studio ](https://developer.android.com/studio) then navigate to the Android folder
   Don't run in web/simulator: Bluetooth will not work
