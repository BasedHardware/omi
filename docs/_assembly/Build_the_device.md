# Building the device

If you received an unassembled Friend or want build one yourself, follow the steps below:

**Step 0.** Components

Ensure you've purchased all required components from the [buying guide] (https://docs.basedhardware.com/assembly/Buying_Guide/).

Download and print the case from the provided .stl file [link](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Friend/blob/main/3d-printing%20designs/Cover%20%2B%20Case.stl).

If you don't have access to a 3D printer, send the file to a 3D printing service or check https://makerspace.com/ for 3D printing spaces.


**Step 1.** Cut the *black wire* approximately 2/3" from the base.

**Step 2.** Carefully remove *just a little bit* of insulation from both ends of the cut wire.

The wire stripper should have multiple notches labeled with AWG sizes. For this project, we recommend using *28 AWG*.

**Step 3.** Follow the soldering diagram to connect the battery and board.

**Step 4.** Ensure the switch is inserted securely into the battery connector.

**Step 6.** Place the switch in the notch next to the USB-C notch

**Step 7.** Gather the longer red wire and gently twist it.

This will help manage the wires when putting on the lid.

**Step 8.** Curl the wire and place it off to the side.

**Step 9.** Attach the lid to the case.

Attaching the lid may take a few tries; make sure to use the ridges as a guide to find the best placement.

**Step 10.** Apply even pressure around the perimeter of the case until the seams snap in place.

**Step 11.** Put the necklace rope
