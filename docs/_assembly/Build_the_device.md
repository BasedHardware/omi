# Build the device

If you purchased an unassembled Friend device or built it yourself using our hardware guide, follow the steps below to flash the firmware:

Important: If you purchased an assembled device please skip this step


**Step 0:** Make sure you have bought everything from the buying guide above

**Step 1:** You need to design the case using 3D printer. Find .stl file [here](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Friend/blob/main/3d-printing%20designs/Cover%20%2B%20Case.stl). If you don't know how to do it, send this file to someone who has a 3d printer

**Step 2:**
Solder everything together like on the picture below. using a soldering kit. Don't have it? buy [this one for $9](https://a.co/d/0XdthUV)

**Step 3:**
Fit everything in the case. Biggest hole is for the usb port. In my example, I put the battery first, then the board and then the switch, however it's not an ideal design. If you will figure out a better solution, please contribute!

**Step 4:** Use hot glue to attach the lid to the case. You can also use a scotch tape first for testing purposes. Last, on the USB-port side, you'll find 2 small round holes. This is where the thread should go through.

Congratulations! you now have a fully working and assembled device!
