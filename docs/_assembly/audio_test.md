# Audio Test

Follow these steps to test audio recording on your computer using a Python script:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.

2. Change to the "test" folder:

   ```
   cd test
   ```

3. Install the required Python modules:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Python script:

   ```
   python local_laptop_client.py
   ```

The recorded audio files will be stored periodically in the `test/recordings` directory.

That's it! You have now set up and tested audio recording on your computer.
