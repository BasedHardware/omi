# Submitting Plugins

To submit your plugin to the FRIEND community:

1. Fork the [FRIEND GitHub repository](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Omi).
2. Locate the `community-plugins.json` file in the repository.
3. Add your **plugin's JSON object** to the end of the array in this file.
4. Double-check the formatting of your JSON
   using [JSON Formatter & Validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) to ensure it's correctly formatted.
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request to the main FRIEND repository.

Your pull request should only contain the addition of your plugin's JSON to the `community-plugins.json` file. Once
approved, your plugin will become available to the FRIEND community.

We approve plugins on a weekly-basis. If there is anything wrong with the submission, we will specify in PR's comments.

Note: Ensure your plugin adheres to our community guidelines and doesn't contain any sensitive or private information
before submitting.
