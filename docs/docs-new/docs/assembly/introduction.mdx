## Is It Cheaper?[​](#is-it-cheaper "Direct link to Is It Cheaper?")

While building your own OMI device is a great learning experience, it may not always be significantly cheaper than purchasing one directly from our [Shop](https://omi.me). The cost depends on the availability of parts in your region, shipping fees, and access to specialized tools.

If cost savings are your main goal, consider comparing the price of parts and tools against the price in our shop before deciding.
