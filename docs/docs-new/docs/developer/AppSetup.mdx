#### Prerequisites[â€‹](#prerequisites "Direct link to Prerequisites")

Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:

* [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install?_gl=1*15npmc9*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE3MzEyNzExNTAuQ2owS0NRaUEwTUc1QmhEMUFSSXNBRWNadHdTR2U5Ujc5bUNNVEk0eDBlVFlMRy1nY2NpT3hSV3JkUUlaaDVjVEc5NU4zTm9BT3JGendja2FBdk9oRUFMd193Y0I.*_gcl_dc*R0NMLjE3MzEyNzExNTAuQ2owS0NRaUEwTUc1QmhEMUFSSXNBRWNadHdTR2U5Ujc5bUNNVEk0eDBlVFlMRy1nY2NpT3hSV3JkUUlaaDVjVEc5NU4zTm9BT3JGendja2FBdk9oRUFMd193Y0I.*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzUzOTkzMzIyLjE3MjgzMzc5MDY.*_ga_04YGWK0175*MTczMTI3MDU5MC40LjEuMTczMTI3MTE1My4wLjAuMA..)
* [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) (for iOS)
* [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) (for Android)
* [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/) (for iOS dependencies)
* [NDK 26.3.11579264](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) or above (to build Opus for ARM Devices)

Building the app automatically means setting up your environment to use Omi's Development backend. That makes it much easier for you to get started - with just one command!

This is the best way to get started, make changes to the app, and build apps on Omi.

Alternatively, you can [build the app manually (see below)](#build-the-app-manually) - which allows you to use your own backend, etc.

**1. Navigate to the `app` directory:**

```
cd app
```

**2. Build the app for iOS:**

```
bash setup.sh ios
```

Note: This works great for iOS simulators! ðŸŽ‰ Want to run on your real device? Ping us on [Discord](https://discord.omi.me) - we'd love to help! (Apple limits us to 100 dev devices)

**3. Build the app for Android:**

```
bash setup.sh android
```

If you use windows, open Git Bash, navigate to /app and type `bash setup.sh android`

**4. Run app in simulator:**

Now that we've built the app, we can run it in the simulator. Open the app in Xcode (open folder `app/ios`) or Android Studio (open folder `app/android`) - then just hit the run button!

Alternatively, run `flutter run --flavor dev` in terminal

## Build the app manually:[â€‹](#build-the-app-manually "Direct link to Build the app manually:")

Setup manually is useful if you want to build the app to use your own backend.

### 1. Upgrade Flutter[â€‹](#1-upgrade-flutter "Direct link to 1. Upgrade Flutter")

Before proceeding, make sure your Flutter SDK is up to date:

```
flutter upgrade
```

### 2. Get Flutter Dependencies[â€‹](#2-get-flutter-dependencies "Direct link to 2. Get Flutter Dependencies")

From within `app` directory, install flutter packages:

```
cd appflutter pub get
```

### 3. Install iOS Pods[â€‹](#3-install-ios-pods "Direct link to 3. Install iOS Pods")

Navigate to the iOS directory and install the CocoaPods dependencies:

```
cd iospod installpod repo update
```

### 4. Environment Configuration[â€‹](#4-environment-configuration "Direct link to 4. Environment Configuration")

Create `.env` using template `.env.template`

```
cd ..cat .env.template > .dev.env
```

### 5. API Keys[â€‹](#5-api-keys "Direct link to 5. API Keys")

Add your API keys to the `.env` file. (Sentry is not needed)

* `API_BASE_URL` is your backend url. You can use our dev backend URL [https://backend-dt5lrfkkoa-uc.a.run.app/](https://backend-dt5lrfkkoa-uc.a.run.app/) or Follow this guide to [install backend](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/backend/Backend_Setup)

### 6. Run Build Runner[â€‹](#6-run-build-runner "Direct link to 6. Run Build Runner")

Generate necessary files with Build Runner:

```
dart run build_runner build
```

### 7. Setup Firebase[â€‹](#7-setup-firebase "Direct link to 7. Setup Firebase")

* Follow official [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) till Step 1

* Run the following command to register the prod flavor of the app. The command will prompt you to select `configuration type`; under it, select `Target` and then `Runner`

  ```
  flutterfire config --out=lib/firebase_options_prod.dart --ios-bundle-id=com.friend-app-with-wearable.ios12 --android-app-id=com.friend.ios --android-out=android/app/src/prod/  --ios-out=ios/Config/Prod/
  ```

* Similarly for dev environment

  ```
  flutterfire config --out=lib/firebase_options_dev.dart --ios-bundle-id=com.friend-app-with-wearable.ios12.develop --android-app-id=com.friend.ios.dev --android-out=android/app/src/dev/  --ios-out=ios/Config/Dev/
  ```

* Generate SHA1/SHA256 Keys for your Keystore and add them to Firebase. Follow the steps mentioned in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56091158) or the [Official Docs](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/9137403?hl=en). This is required for Firebase Auth through Google OAuth to work.

If you're facing auth issues running the app, enable Google/Apple sign-in in Firebase. Go to the Firebase console and select your project. In the left-hand menu, click on "Authentication." On the "Sign-in method" tab, scroll down to the "Sign-in providers" section. Click on the "Google" sign-in provider. Click the "Enable" switch to enable Google Sign-In for your Firebase project.

### 8. Run the App[â€‹](#8-run-the-app "Direct link to 8. Run the App")

* Select your target device in Xcode or Android Studio.
* Run the app.
