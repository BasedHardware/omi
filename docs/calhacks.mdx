## Welcome

Build something audacious on top of the Omi developer kit at CalHacks. This guide walks you through getting hardware, choosing a project, scoping features, and submitting your app so you can demo it during the hackathon.

## Documentation quick links

- Main docs: [docs.omi.me](http://docs.omi.me)
- How to create an Omi app: [Step‚Äëby‚Äëstep guide](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Introduction)

The docs also cover integration‚Äëbased apps, submission flow inside the OMI App Store, and OAuth setup and best practices. Start with the main docs, then follow the app creation guide, and use the integrations and OAuth sections when you connect external APIs.

## Download the Omi app

- iOS: [Download on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/friend-ai-wearable/id6502156163)
- Android: [Get it on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.friend.ios)
- macOS: [Download on the Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omi-ai-smart-meeting-notes/id6502156163)

Install the app on your demo devices now so you can submit and test your build quickly.

## üß∞ Pick up the Omi developer kit

1. Go to the Hardware Booth and ask for the "Omi developer kit."
2. If kits are available, get one for yourself and your teammates. (You don't have to return it.)

<Info>
If kits run out, you can still prototype with our SDKs and submit a software-only app.

## üß± Build your app on Omi

You can build any idea, but we highly recommend the options below because they're impactful and fun to demo. Voice-first UX is essential.

## Suggested project ideas

### A) Ride‚Äëhailing by voice (Uber/Lyft)

Core flow:

- "Get me a ride to [destination]."
- Confirm price, ETA, and service level (UberX, Lyft, etc.).
- Confirm and place the request.

Implementation tips:

- Use Omi for speech in/out and intent parsing.
- Use official ride APIs or deep links to prefill rides if direct APIs are restricted.
- Handle edge cases: surge pricing, no drivers, location permissions.

Demo moment:

- Speak destination, hear quote, confirm, then show the ride screen with ETA.

### B) Food delivery by voice (DoorDash/Grubhub/Uber Eats)

Core flow:

- "Order a pepperoni pizza from the closest highly rated place."
- Confirm restaurant, items, price, and delivery address.
- Submit order or generate a cart link for user confirmation.

Implementation tips:

- Use menu search endpoints or fallback to web parsing with user confirmation.
- Support quick re-orders: "Order my usual."
- Offer dietary filters and substitution prompts.

Demo moment:

- Voice-only cart build with a spoken summary and on-device confirmation.

### C) Rizz Meter for Dates (conversation coaching)

Goal:

- Help people have warmer, more respectful dates by giving post‚Äëconversation insights and optional gentle live nudges.

What "rizz" means here (for dating):

- A blend of warmth, attentiveness, reciprocity, and chemistry signals. It is not a judgment of attractiveness or value.

Dating‚Äërelevant signals to start with

- Reciprocity and turn‚Äëtaking: balanced talk time, low interruption rate, timely back‚Äëchannels.
- Attentiveness: question rate, follow‚Äëups referencing prior details, memory of preferences.
- Warmth: sentiment trajectory, positive acknowledgments, appreciation phrases.
- Comfort and pacing: speaking rate stability, pause tolerance, laughter or lightness markers.
- Boundary respect: honoring topics the other person avoids, not pushing after a "no."

How to compute a score

1) Normalize signals per speaker and conversation length.

2) Map to sub‚Äëscores: Warmth, Attentiveness, Reciprocity, Comfort.

3) Aggregate into a 0‚Äì100 Date Rizz score + a short, human summary and 2‚Äì3 tips.

Product behaviors

- Post‚Äëdate mode: Show sub‚Äëscores, a highlights reel of strong moments, and suggested prompts for next time.
- Optional live hints: Very subtle, privacy‚Äësafe cue like "Ask a follow‚Äëup" only when confidence is high.

Example output

- "Date Rizz 78. Strong: great follow‚Äëups and balanced turns. Try: slightly longer pauses after jokes, and acknowledge their last story before switching topics."

Implementation notes

- Use Omi streaming transcripts and timestamps; compute features locally when possible.
- Add a lightweight "topics" memory to generate personalized follow‚Äëups.
- Smooth live nudges with a rolling window to avoid jittery cues.

Consent, privacy, and safety (critical for dates)

- Get explicit opt‚Äëin from both people before recording. If either declines, disable.
- Do not store raw audio; keep ephemeral features or summaries only.
- Avoid sensitive inference (appearance, identity, medical). Provide a one‚Äëtap delete‚Äëall.
- Frame results as coaching suggestions, not truth. Never pressure outcomes.

Demo moment

- Run a 60‚Äësecond mock "first date" chat. Show a post‚Äëdate panel with one highlight, one small improvement, and two suggested follow‚Äëup questions for next time.

### D) "Lie detector" using third‚Äëparty signals (e.g., Hume, etc.)

Implementation tips:

- Combine conversation transcript with a third‚Äëparty prosody/affect signal.
- Output should be a confidence‚Äëlight, explanation‚Äëheavy "anomalies" view, not a verdict.
- Provide a transparent disclaimer and opt‚Äëout controls.

Demo moment:

- Walk through a consent screen, run a staged conversation, then show an "anomaly timeline."

### E) IQ detector

Implementation tips:

- Focus on task performance analytics (puzzle prompts, memory span) rather than labeling people.
- Show question types, difficulty curves, and confidence intervals. No absolute "IQ" claims.

Demo moment:

- Interactive challenge with a real‚Äëtime skills profile visualization.

### Build anything else bold and challenging

If you have another idea of similar ambition, go for it. Make it voice‚Äëfirst, fast, and demo‚Äëable within 2‚Äì3 minutes.

---

## ‚úÖ Minimum viable demo checklist

- Voice in and out working reliably at the venue.
- One core task completed end‚Äëto‚Äëend.
- A 60‚Äì120 second demo script with a wow moment.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical setup

- Device setup: pair/connect, test mic and speaker latency.
- Integrations: connect required third‚Äëparty APIs or use deep links as a backup.
- State and storage: keep session state and a lightweight local cache for your demo.
- Logging: console plus a simple on‚Äëdevice log view to debug on‚Äëfloor issues.

---

## üì§ Submit and use your app at CalHacks

1. Open the Omi mobile app and go to the App Store.
2. Submit your app from within the Omi app. Include team name, short description, and a demo note.
3. After submission, your app should appear in your account for immediate use so you can demo it during CalHacks.
4. We will review apps after the event to determine Omi Awards.

<Info>
This is not an official hackathon "track." You can still compete in other tracks and use your Omi app as part of those projects.

- Live demo: run the core flow in under 60 seconds.
- Edge case: show a graceful failure or safety check.
- Close: what you'd ship post‚Äëhackathon.

---

## üßØ Troubleshooting quick tips

- Audio not detected: check mic permissions and venue noise; reduce wake sensitivity or use push‚Äëto‚Äëtalk.
- API failures: add retries and read back a friendly error with next best action.
- Latency spikes: prefetch and cache prompts, compress payloads, avoid unnecessary round‚Äëtrips.
- Device power: keep the device plugged in during long demos.

**Good luck and have fun building! üöÄ**
