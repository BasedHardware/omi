# Contribution

We welcome contributions from the community! If you are interested in improving Friend, our current biggest goal is to combine both apps together (AppStandalone with AppWithWearable)

- Standalone App brings great prompts and rich structure

- AppWithWearable brings simple bluetooth connecting functionality
