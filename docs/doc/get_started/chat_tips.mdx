## How Your Questions Get Processed

When you ask Omi a question, it goes through an intelligent routing system that determines the best way to answer:

<Info>
Understanding these paths helps you frame questions that get the richest, most relevant answers.
</Info>

### Simple Chat Path
**For:** Greetings, general advice, brainstorming

Questions like "Hi!", "What's a good book to read?", or "Tips for productivity" get fast, direct responses without searching your memories.

### Agentic Path (Context-Rich)
**For:** Personal data, temporal queries, integration lookups

Questions like "What did I discuss yesterday?", "Show my calendar", or "What are my goals?" trigger the full agentic system with access to 22+ tools that search your conversations, memories, calendar, and connected services.

### Persona Path
**For:** Character-based apps

If you're chatting with a persona app (like "Ask Einstein"), responses come from that character's perspective.

## Prompting Strategies

### 1. Be Specific with Time

Omi excels at temporal queries. The system converts relative time references to precise date ranges.

<Tip>
Use natural time expressions - the system understands them perfectly.
</Tip>

**Great examples:**
- "What did I discuss yesterday?"
- "Summarize my last 3 days"
- "What happened this morning?"
- "Conversations from last week"
- "What did I talk about on Monday?"

**Less effective:**
- Vague timeframes without anchors ("a while ago")
- Very broad ranges ("everything from this year")

### 2. Use Natural Language for Topics

Omi uses **semantic search** - it finds conversations by meaning, not just keywords. Ask naturally!

**Great examples:**
- "What have I discussed about my health?"
- "Conversations about career growth"
- "Times I talked about feeling stressed"
- "Discussions involving my manager"
- "What have I said about the project launch?"

**Why it works:** The system embeds your question and finds conversations with similar meaning, even if they use different words.

### 3. Ask About Yourself

Omi builds a knowledge base of facts about you across all conversations. Tap into it!

**Great examples:**
- "What do you know about me?"
- "What are my goals?"
- "Who do I talk to most?"
- "What are my preferences?"
- "What hobbies have I mentioned?"

**Why it works:** This triggers the memories system, which stores structured facts extracted from your conversations.

### 4. Leverage Your Integrations

If you've connected services, ask about them directly.

**Google Calendar:**
- "What meetings do I have today?"
- "When is my next meeting with Sarah?"
- "Schedule a meeting with John at 3 PM tomorrow"

**Gmail:**
- "Show my recent emails about the project"
- "Emails from John this week"

**Whoop (Health):**
- "How was my sleep last night?"
- "What's my recovery score today?"
- "Show my workouts this week"

**GitHub:**
- "My open pull requests"
- "Issues assigned to me"

**Notion:**
- "Search my notes about product roadmap"

## Example Questions by Category

| Category | Great Questions | Why They Work |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Time-Based** | "What did I do yesterday?", "Summarize my week" | Clear time bounds trigger precise date filtering |
| **Topic Search** | "What have I said about AI?", "My health discussions" | Semantic search finds conceptually related conversations |
| **People** | "Conversations with John", "What did Sarah mention?" | People filter in search + vector similarity |
| **Action Items** | "What tasks do I have?", "What do I need to do?" | Direct access to action item system |
| **Personal Facts** | "What's my favorite food?", "Where do I work?" | Memory retrieval of stored facts |
| **Analysis** | "How productive was I this month?", "Patterns in my week" | Multi-tool orchestration for comprehensive answers |
| **Calendar** | "My meetings tomorrow", "When am I free this week?" | Calendar integration for schedule awareness |

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
These advanced strategies are based on how the system is designed internally.
</Tip>

### 1. Combine Time + Topic
Narrow results by specifying both when and what:
- "What did I discuss about the project **last week**?"
- "Conversations about health **this month**"
- "What did John say **yesterday**?"

### 2. Ask Follow-ups
The system remembers your last 10 messages. Build on previous answers:
- First: "What did I discuss yesterday?"
- Follow-up: "Tell me more about the second one"
- Follow-up: "What action items came from that?"

### 3. Be Direct
Skip pleasantries when you need information:
- **Better:** "My tasks for today"
- **Slower:** "Hey, could you maybe show me what I need to do today?"

### 4. Use Relative Dates
The system handles relative dates better than absolute ones:
- **Better:** "yesterday", "last 3 days", "this morning"
- **Works but slower:** "January 15th, 2024"

### 5. Request Summaries
Trigger comprehensive retrieval with summary requests:
- "Summarize my week"
- "Give me an overview of my conversations yesterday"
- "What were the key themes from last month?"

### 6. Ask for Specific Counts
When you want thorough results:
- "Show me my last 10 conversations"
- "What are my top 5 priorities?"

## What NOT to Ask

<Warning>
Some question patterns don't work well due to system design.
</Warning>

| Avoid | Why | Better Alternative |
|-------|-----|---------------------|
| "Tell me everything" | Too broad, hits context limits | "Summarize my last week" |
| "Search all my data" | No specific intent to optimize for | "What topics do I discuss most?" |
| Extremely old queries | Vectors may not exist for old conversations | Focus on recent conversations |
| Breaking persona character | Confuses persona apps | Stay in character with persona apps |
| Questions about other users | Privacy boundaries | Focus on your own data |

## Integration-Specific Tips

### Google Calendar
Best practices for calendar queries:

- **Check schedule:** "What meetings do I have today?" or "Am I free at 3 PM?"
- **Find meetings:** "When is my next meeting with [name]?"
- **Create events:** "Schedule a meeting with John tomorrow at 2 PM about project review"
- **Modify events:** "Move my 3 PM meeting to 4 PM"

### Gmail
Best practices for email queries:

- **Search by sender:** "Emails from John this week"
- **Search by topic:** "Recent emails about the contract"
- **Combine filters:** "Emails from Sarah about the project in the last 3 days"

### Whoop (Health & Fitness)
Best practices for health queries:

- **Sleep:** "How was my sleep last night?" or "Sleep quality this week"
- **Recovery:** "What's my recovery score today?"
- **Workouts:** "Show my workouts this week" or "How much strain yesterday?"
- **Trends:** "How has my sleep been this month?"

### GitHub
Best practices for development queries:

- **PRs:** "My open pull requests" or "PRs I need to review"
- **Issues:** "Issues assigned to me" or "Open issues in [repo]"
- **Create:** "Create an issue for the login bug in [repo]"

### Notion
Best practices for Notion queries:

- **Search:** "Search my notes about [topic]"
- **Find pages:** "Find my page about project roadmap"

## Understanding Citations

When Omi answers questions using your conversations, it includes numbered citations like `[1]` and `[2]`. These link to the source conversations.

- **Tap citations** in the app to view the full conversation
- **Multiple citations** mean information came from multiple conversations
- **No citations** means the answer came from general knowledge or your stored memories (facts about you)

## Quick Reference Card

### Best Question Patterns:

```
Time-based:    "What did I [verb] [time period]?"
Topic-based:   "What have I discussed about [topic]?"
Person-based:  "Conversations with [name]" or "What did [name] say?"
Action items:  "What tasks do I have?" or "My to-dos"
Personal:      "What do you know about my [aspect]?"
Calendar:      "My meetings [time period]"
Summary:       "Summarize my [time period]"
```

### Power Combinations:

```
Time + Topic:   "What did I discuss about [topic] [time period]?"
Time + Person:  "Conversations with [name] [time period]"
Topic + Person: "What did [name] say about [topic]?"
All three:      "What did [name] and I discuss about [topic] [time period]?"
```
