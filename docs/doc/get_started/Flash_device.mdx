# Flashing Instructions for Consumer Version 1 (CV1)

## Flashing Omi Firmware v3.0.8

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for flashing the Omi firmware using J-Link on both macOS and Windows systems.

### Prerequisites

- Omi CV1 device connected via USB  
- J-Link software installed (see installation instructions below)  
- Appropriate USB drivers for your device  
- Latest firmware files downloaded from GitHub releases  

### Special Hardware Requirement

To flash the Omi CV1, you must use a **special flashing cable** that connects the device to the J-Link programmer.  
This cable provides the required SWD/JTAG interface and must be acquired before attempting to flash.  
Without this cable, the CV1 cannot be programmed. Ensure that:

- The cable is properly connected to both the Omi CV1 and the J-Link programmer (pinout must match SWDIO, SWCLK, GND, VCC).  
- The cable is secure and undamaged before starting the flashing process.  

‚ö†Ô∏è If you do not have this cable, you will need to source one before proceeding with the CV1 flashing steps.

### Important: Update Firmware Files Before Flashing

‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Step**: Before flashing, you must replace the existing firmware files with the latest versions from GitHub releases.

#### Step 1: Download Latest Firmware

1. Go to the [Omi GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/releases)  
2. Find the latest release version  
3. Download the following files:  
   - `merged.hex` ‚Äî Application core firmware  
   - `merged_CPUNET.hex` ‚Äî Network core firmware  

#### Step 2: Replace Existing Firmware Files

**For macOS:**
1. Navigate to the `MAC/` folder in your FLASH_3.0.8 directory  
2. (Optional) Backup existing files:
   ```bash
   mv merged.hex merged.hex.backup
   mv merged_CPUNET.hex merged_CPUNET.hex.backup
   ```
3. Copy the downloaded `merged.hex` and `merged_CPUNET.hex` into the `MAC/` folder  

**For Windows:**
1. Navigate to the `WINDOWS\` folder in your FLASH_3.0.8 directory  
2. (Optional) Backup existing files:
   - Rename `merged.hex` ‚Üí `merged.hex.backup`  
   - Rename `merged_CPUNET.hex` ‚Üí `merged_CPUNET.hex.backup`  
3. Copy the downloaded `merged.hex` and `merged_CPUNET.hex` into the `WINDOWS\` folder  

#### Step 3: Verify File Replacement

- Ensure both `merged.hex` and `merged_CPUNET.hex` are updated  
- File sizes should match the downloaded versions  
- Modification dates should reflect the replacement  

### macOS Instructions

1. Install J-Link Software from [SEGGER](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)  
2. Navigate to the `MAC` folder:
   ```bash
   cd MAC
   ```
3. Flash the firmware:
   ```bash
   # Flash network core first
   JLinkExe -CommanderScript program_net.jlink
   
   # Then flash application core
   JLinkExe -CommanderScript program_app.jlink
   ```

### Windows Instructions

1. Install J-Link Software from [SEGGER](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/)  
   - Add J-Link installation path to your Windows PATH (default: `C:\Program Files\SEGGER\JLink\`)  
2. Navigate to the `WINDOWS` folder:
   ```cmd
   cd WINDOWS
   ```
3. Flash the firmware:
   ```cmd
   # Flash network core first
   JLink.exe -CommanderScript program_net.jlink
   
   # Then flash application core
   JLink.exe -CommanderScript program_app.jlink
   ```

### Verification

- If LEDs start blinking ‚Üí flashing was successful üéâ  
- Device should now run the latest firmware  
- Confirm firmware version in the Omi app or device interface  

### Troubleshooting

1. **JLinkExe not found** ‚Üí Recheck installation and PATH  
2. **Connection issues** ‚Üí Try another USB port/cable, ensure programming mode  
3. **Flashing fails** ‚Üí Flash network core first, wait for commands to complete  
4. **Firmware file errors** ‚Üí Ensure files are latest, re-download if corrupted
