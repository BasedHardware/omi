title: "Cursor Configuration (.cursor)"
description: "How Omi uses the .cursor folder (rules, skills, commands, and agents) to guide AI assistance in this repository."
---

## Overview

This repo includes a `.cursor/` directory that configures Cursor + AI agents to work effectively across Omi’s codebase. It contains:

- Rules that apply based on file patterns (backend/flutter/web/etc.)
- Reusable “skills” and slash commands
- Specialized agents (e.g. backend API, Flutter, firmware)
- Internal reference docs for agents (not the same as the public `docs/` site)

If you’re contributing to Omi and using Cursor, understanding `.cursor/` makes it much easier to add consistent automation and avoid common mistakes.

---

## `.cursor/` vs `docs/` (important)

- **`docs/`** is the **single source of truth for user-facing documentation** and is what gets deployed to `docs.omi.me`.
- **`.cursor/`** is **editor/agent configuration** intended to help contributors and AI tooling inside this repo.

In other words: **we document `.cursor/` publicly here (so contributors can use it), but `.cursor/docs/` is not the public documentation site**.

---

## What’s inside `.cursor/`

### Rules (`.cursor/rules/`)

Rules are small, focused guidance files (typically `*.mdc`) that apply automatically based on globs (e.g. `backend/**/*.py`, `app/**/*.dart`, `web/**/*.ts(x)`).

Typical rule topics:
- **Architecture**: module boundaries + import hierarchy
- **Testing & verification**: what to run before merging
- **Style and conventions**: formatting, localization requirements, common mistakes

### Skills (`.cursor/skills/`)

Skills are reusable “playbooks” for recurring workflows. A skill folder typically contains:

- `SKILL.md`: the skill’s instructions and checklists
- `commands/`: slash commands (e.g. `/backend-test`, `/pr`)
- `agents/`: specialized agents that focus on specific domains

### Commands (`.cursor/commands/`)

Legacy / general commands that show up in Cursor when you type `/`. (Many commands also live under `skills/*/commands/`.)

### Agents (`.cursor/agents/`)

Legacy / compatibility agent definitions. Most agents live under `skills/*/agents/`.

### Internal agent docs (`.cursor/docs/`)

Internal reference docs used by agents (architecture maps, component indexes, internal guidance).

**Note**: These are for agent operation and contributor context, not for end users.

### Hooks (`.cursor/hooks/` and `.cursor/hooks.json`)

Optional hook scripts/config to observe and extend the agent loop. Useful for enforcing workflows, validation, and automation.

### MCP config (`.cursor/mcp.json`)

Configuration for MCP servers that provide external tools (e.g. browser testing, GitHub automation, Notion/Figma integration if enabled).

## Common contributor workflows

### Add a new rule

1. Add a focused rule file under `.cursor/rules/` (e.g. `backend-foo.mdc`)
2. Ensure it targets the correct file glob(s)
3. Keep it actionable: conventions + “how to verify”

### Add a new skill

1. Create `.cursor/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Put any related slash commands under `.cursor/skills/<skill-name>/commands/`
3. Put any related agents under `.cursor/skills/<skill-name>/agents/`

### Update public documentation

If your change affects user-facing behavior or developer APIs:

- Update `docs/` (public)
- Add/adjust nav entries in `docs/docs.json` if you add a new page

## Safety & maintenance notes

- **Don’t put secrets** (tokens, keys, credentials) in `.cursor/` files.
- Keep rules **layer-aware** (e.g. don’t encourage importing from `routers/` inside `utils/`).
- Prefer linking to **public docs in `docs/`** when something is user-facing, and keep `.cursor/docs/` for internal agent context.
