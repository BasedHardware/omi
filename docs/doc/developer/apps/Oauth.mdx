## Overview

OMI uses an OAuth 2.0-like flow to allow third-party applications to access OMI user data with their explicit consent. This ensures that users have control over their data and what applications can access.

When an application wants to access a user's OMI data, it directs the user to OMI's authorization server. The user logs in with their OMI account (via Firebase - Google or Apple) and approves the permissions requested by the application. OMI then provides the application with a user identifier (`uid`) which can be used to interact with OMI APIs on behalf of the user.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure your application is registered with OMI and has an `App ID`. You also need to configure an **App Home URL** in your app's settings within the OMI platform. This URL is where users will be redirected after successfully authorizing your application.

## OAuth Flow

The OMI OAuth flow consists of the following steps:

1.  **User Authorization Request**: Your application redirects the user to the OMI OAuth authorization endpoint.
2.  **User Authentication & Consent**: The user logs into their OMI account (if not already logged in) and reviews the permissions requested by your application. If they approve, they grant consent.
3.  **Token Exchange & User Redirection**: After successful authentication and consent, OMI's authorization page will internally facilitate the exchange of the Firebase ID token (obtained client-side) for an OMI user ID (`uid`). The user is then redirected back to your application's **App Home URL** with the `uid` and an optional `state` parameter.

### Step 1: Redirect User to OMI for Authorization

Your application initiates the OAuth flow by redirecting the user's browser to OMI's authorization endpoint:

`https://api.omi.me/v1/oauth/authorize?app_id=YOUR_APP_ID&state=YOUR_OPAQUE_STATE_STRING`

**Parameters:**

*   `app_id` (required): Your application's unique ID.
*   `state` (optional): An opaque value used to maintain state between the request and callback. This is useful for preventing CSRF attacks and can also store application-specific state. OMI will return this value to your application after the user authorizes your app.


### Step 2: User Authentication and Consent

Upon visiting the `/v1/oauth/authorize` URL, the user will be presented with an OMI page where they can:
1.  Log in using their Firebase credentials (Google or Apple).
2.  Review the permissions your application is requesting. These permissions are derived from the capabilities configured for your app (e.g., access chat, read/create memories, etc.).
3.  Grant or deny access.

The permissions displayed are user-friendly descriptions based on your app's declared capabilities, such as:
- "Engage in chat conversations with Omi."
- "Access and manage your conversations."
- "Process audio data in real-time."
- "Trigger actions when new conversations are created."
- "Create new conversations on your behalf."
- "Access and read your stored memories."
- "Access your basic Omi profile information." (This may be shown as a default if no other specific permissions are applicable or as a general permission).

### Step 3: Token Exchange and Redirection to Your App

This step is primarily handled by the client-side JavaScript on the OMI authorization page after the user successfully logs in via Firebase.

1.  **Firebase Authentication**: The user authenticates with Firebase on the OMI authorization page.
2.  **Token POST**: The client-side script on the OMI authorization page makes a `POST` request to:

    `POST https://api.omi.me/v1/oauth/token`

    **Request Body (form-data):**
    *   `firebase_id_token` (required): The ID token obtained from Firebase after successful user login on the OMI page.
    *   `app_id` (required): Your application's unique ID.
    *   `state` (optional): The `state` parameter that was initially passed to the `/v1/oauth/authorize` endpoint.

    **Response (JSON):**
    If successful, the `/v1/oauth/token` endpoint responds with a JSON object containing:
    ```json
    {
      "uid": "USER_UNIQUE_ID",
      "redirect_url": "YOUR_APP_HOME_URL",
      "state": "YOUR_OPAQUE_STATE_STRING_IF_PROVIDED"
    }
    ```
    - `uid`: The unique identifier for the OMI user.
    - `redirect_url`: Your application's configured **App Home URL**.
    - `state`: The `state` parameter, if it was included in the initial authorization request.

3.  **Redirection to App Home URL**: The client-side script on the OMI authorization page then uses the `redirect_url`, `uid`, and `state` from the response to redirect the user's browser to your application.

    **Example Redirect URL constructed by the client-side script:**
    ```
    YOUR_APP_HOME_URL?uid=USER_UNIQUE_ID&state=YOUR_OPAQUE_STATE_STRING
    ```

Your application, at its **App Home URL**, can then retrieve the `uid` from the query parameters to identify the user. If you used a `state` parameter, your application should validate it against the value it initially sent to protect against CSRF attacks.

## Automatic App Enablement

When a user successfully completes the OAuth flow for your app:
- If the app is not already enabled for the user, OMI will attempt to enable it automatically as part of the `/v1/oauth/token` processing.
- This automatic enablement process includes several checks:
    - **Privacy**: If the app is marked as private, only the app owner or designated testers can enable it.
    - **Setup Completion**: If the app has a `setup_completed_url` configured in its `external_integration` settings, OMI will make a GET request to this URL (appending `?uid={user_uid}`). Your app's `setup_completed_url` endpoint must return a JSON response: `{"is_setup_completed": true}` for the flow to proceed. If it returns `false` or fails, an error will be shown.
    - **Payment**: If the app is a paid app, OMI verifies that the user has an active subscription or has otherwise fulfilled the payment requirements.
- If all these checks pass, the app is enabled for the user, and its public install count may be incremented (if applicable).
- If any check fails (e.g., setup not completed, payment required), the OAuth flow will be halted before redirection, and an appropriate error message will be displayed to the user.

## App Configuration

To use OMI OAuth, ensure your app is configured within the OMI platform with:
- An **App ID**.
- An **App Home URL**: This is the primary URL of your application where users will be redirected after authorization. It must be an HTTPS URL. This URL is specified in the `external_integration.app_home_url` field of your app's configuration.

These settings are typically managed through the OMI developer portal or during the app submission process.
