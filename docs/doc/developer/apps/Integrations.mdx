## What Are Integration Apps?

Integration apps allow Omi to interact with external services by sending data to your webhook endpoints. Unlike prompt-based apps, these require you to host a server.

## Memory Creation Triggers

These apps are activated when Omi creates a new memory, allowing you to process or store the data externally.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How It Works" icon="gear">
    1. User completes a conversation
    2. Omi processes and creates a memory
    3. Your webhook receives the complete memory object
    4. Your server processes and responds

    The webhook receives the full conversation data including transcript, structured summary, action items, and metadata.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">
    - **Slack Integration**: Post conversation summaries to team channels
    - **CRM Updates**: Log customer interactions automatically
    - **Project Management**: Create tasks in Notion, Asana, or Jira
    - **Knowledge Base**: Build a searchable archive of conversations
    - **Analytics**: Track conversation patterns and insights

### Webhook Payload

Your endpoint receives a POST request with the memory object:

`POST /your-endpoint?uid=user123`

```json
{
  "id": "memory_abc123",
  "created_at": "2024-07-22T23:59:45.910559+00:00",
  "started_at": "2024-07-21T22:34:43.384323+00:00",
  "finished_at": "2024-07-21T22:35:43.384323+00:00",
  "transcript_segments": [
    {
      "text": "Let's discuss the project timeline.",
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
      "speakerId": 0,
      "speaker_name": "Speaker 0",
      "is_user": false,
      "start": 10.0,
      "end": 15.0
    }
  ],

## Real-Time Transcript Processors

Process conversation transcripts as they occur, enabling real-time analysis and actions.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How It Works" icon="gear">
    1. User starts speaking
    2. Omi transcribes in real-time
    3. Your webhook receives transcript segments as they're created
    4. Your server processes and can trigger immediate actions

    Segments arrive in multiple calls as the conversation unfolds, allowing for live reactions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">
    - **Live Coaching**: Provide real-time feedback during presentations
    - **Fact-Checking**: Verify claims as they're made
    - **Smart Home**: Trigger actions based on spoken commands
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: Monitor emotional tone in real-time
    - **Translation**: Live translation of conversations
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Video Tutorial" icon="video">
    <iframe
      width="560"
      height="315"

      allowfullscreen
    ></iframe>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Webhook Payload

Your endpoint receives transcript segments with session context:

`POST /your-endpoint?session_id=abc123&uid=user123`

```json
[
  {
    "text": "I think we should prioritize the mobile app.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
    "speakerId": 0,
    "is_user": false,
    "start": 10.0,
    "end": 15.0
  },
  {
    "text": "Agreed, let's start with iOS.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_01",
    "speakerId": 1,
    "is_user": true,
    "start": 16.0,
    "end": 18.0
  }
]
```

### Implementation Tips

<Warning>
Real-time processors require careful design to avoid performance issues.

## Real-Time Audio Bytes

Stream raw audio bytes from Omi directly to your endpoint for custom audio processing.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How It Works" icon="gear">
    1. User speaks into Omi device
    2. Raw PCM audio is streamed to your endpoint
    3. Your server processes the audio bytes directly
    4. Handle as needed (custom STT, VAD, feature extraction, etc.)

    Unlike transcript processors, you receive the actual audio data, not text.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">
    - **Custom ASR**: Use your own speech recognition models
    - **Voice Activity Detection**: Implement custom VAD logic
    - **Audio Features**: Extract spectrograms, embeddings, or other features
    - **Recording**: Store raw audio for later processing
    - **Real-time Translation**: Feed audio to translation services
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Technical Details

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Trigger Type | `audio_bytes` |
| HTTP Method | POST |
| Content-Type | `application/octet-stream` |
| Audio Format | PCM16 (16-bit little-endian) |
| Bytes per Sample | 2 |

**Request format:**

`POST /your-endpoint?sample_rate=16000&uid=user123`

Body contains raw PCM16 audio bytes.

<Note>
To produce a playable WAV file, prepend a WAV header and concatenate the received chunks.
</Note>

### Configuring Delivery Frequency

You can control how often audio is sent via the Omi app Developer Settings:

```
url,seconds
```

For example: `https://your-endpoint.com/audio,5` sends audio every 5 seconds.

<Info>
For a complete implementation, see the [Audio Streaming Guide](/doc/developer/apps/AudioStreaming).

## Creating an Integration App

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your Trigger Type" icon="toggle-on">
    Decide which integration type(s) you need:
    - **Memory Trigger**: Process completed conversations
    - **Real-Time Transcript**: React to live speech
    - **Audio Bytes**: Process raw audio
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Up Your Endpoint" icon="server">
    Create a webhook endpoint that can receive POST requests. For testing, use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) or [webhook-test.com](https://webhook-test.com/).

    Your endpoint should:
    - Accept POST requests
    - Parse JSON body (or binary for audio)
    - Read `uid` from query parameters
    - Return 200 OK quickly
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Your Logic" icon="code">
    Process the incoming data and integrate with external services.

    **Example (Python/FastAPI):**
    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

    app = FastAPI()

    @app.post("/webhook")
    async def handle_memory(request: Request, uid: str):
        memory = await request.json()
        # Process memory data
        await send_to_slack(memory["structured"]["title"])
        return {"status": "ok"}
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Your Integration" icon="flask">
    Use Developer Mode to test without creating new memories (see testing section below)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit Your App" icon="rocket">
    Publish through the Omi mobile app
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Testing Your Integration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Developer Mode" icon="code">
    Open Omi app → Settings → Enable Developer Mode → Developer Settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Webhook URL" icon="link">
    - **Memory Triggers**: Enter URL in "Memory Creation Webhook"
    - **Real-Time**: Enter URL in "Real-Time Transcript Webhook"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Memory Triggers" icon="bell">
    Go to any memory → Tap 3-dot menu → Developer Tools → Trigger webhook with existing data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test Real-Time" icon="bolt">
    Start speaking - your endpoint receives updates immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use [webhook.site](https://webhook.site) to see exactly what data Omi sends before writing any code.
</Tip>

## App Submission Fields

When submitting your integration app:

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Webhook URL** | Yes | Your POST endpoint for receiving data |
| **Setup Completed URL** | No | GET endpoint returning `{"is_setup_completed": boolean}` |
| **Auth URL** | No | URL for user authentication (uid appended automatically) |
| **Setup Instructions** | No | Text or link explaining how to configure your app |

### Setup Instructions Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Step-by-Step Guide" icon="list-ol">
    Clear numbered instructions for configuration
  </Card>
  <Card title="Screenshots" icon="image">
    Visual aids for complex setup steps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Authentication Flow" icon="key">
    If required, explain how to connect accounts
  </Card>
  <Card title="Troubleshooting" icon="screwdriver-wrench">
    Common issues and how to resolve them
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
When users open your setup links, Omi automatically appends a `uid` query parameter. Use this to associate credentials with specific users.
