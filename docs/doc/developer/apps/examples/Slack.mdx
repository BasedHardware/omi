## Features

- **Voice-Activated** - Say "Send message" and speak naturally
- **AI-Powered Channel Matching** - AI intelligently matches spoken channel names to your workspace
- **OAuth Authentication** - Secure Slack OAuth 2.0 integration

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the App">
    Install the Slack app in your OMI mobile app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    Authenticate your Slack workspace (one-time setup)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Default Channel">
    Choose a default channel (optional - you can specify in voice)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Messaging">
    - Say: "Send message to general saying hello team!"
    - Say: "Post in marketing that the campaign is live"
    - Say: "Slack message to random saying great idea!"
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Trigger Phrases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supported Voice Triggers">
    - "Send Slack message" - "Send Slack message to general saying..."
    - "Post Slack message" - "Post Slack message in marketing that..."
    - "Post in Slack" - "Post in Slack to random saying..."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How It Works

**The app intelligently processes your voice commands:**
1. Detects trigger phrase → Starts collecting
2. Collects up to 5 segments OR stops if 5+ second gap detected
3. AI extracts:
   - Channel name (fuzzy matches to your workspace channels)
   - Message content (cleaned and formatted)
4. Fetches fresh channel list automatically (new channels work immediately!)
5. Posts message to Slack
6. Notifies you with confirmation!

<Note>
**Example Workflow:**

You: "Send Slack message to general saying hello team"  
*[collecting segment 1/5...]*

You: "hope everyone is having a great day"  
*[collecting segment 2/5...]*  
*[5+ second pause - timeout!]*  
*→ AI processes 2 segments*

**AI Extracted:**
- **Channel:** #general
- **Message:** "Hello team, hope everyone is having a great day."

→ Message sent!
</Note>

## Using the App

### With OMI Device

1. Install the Slack app from the OMI App Store
2. Authenticate your Slack workspace
3. Select a default channel (optional)
4. Say: "Send message to general saying hello team!"
5. Wait for AI processing (happens silently)
6. Get a notification with confirmation!

## AI Processing

The app uses OpenAI for intelligent processing:

1. **Channel Matching** - Fuzzy matches spoken channel names to workspace channels
2. **Message Extraction** - Extracts clean message content from voice segments
3. **Cleanup** - Removes filler words, fixes grammar, proper formatting

**Example Transformation:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Voice Input (3 segments)
"to general saying um hello team hope you're all um doing great today"
```

```markdown AI-Extracted Message
Channel: #general (matched from "general")
Message: "Hello team, hope you're all doing great today"
```
</CodeGroup>

## How Segments Work

**OMI sends transcripts in segments** as you speak. The app:
- Detects trigger phrase (Send Slack message / Post Slack message / Post in Slack)
- Collects up to 5 segments MAX
- Processes early if 5+ second gap detected (minimum 2 segments)
- Silent during collection (no spam)
- AI processes all collected segments together
- One notification on completion

**Smart Collection:**
- **Max segments:** 5 (including trigger)
- **Timeout:** 5 seconds of silence → processes immediately
- **Minimum:** 2 segments (trigger + content)
- **Duration:** ~5-20 seconds depending on speech
- **Auto-refresh:** Fetches latest channels every time (new channels work immediately!)

## Channel Management

### Specifying Channel in Voice

You can always specify the channel in your voice command:
- "Send message to **general** saying hello"
- "Post in **marketing** that campaign is live"
- "Message to **engineering** about the bug fix"

AI will fuzzy match to your workspace channels!

### Using Default Channel

Set a default channel in settings, then just say:
- "Send message saying quick update for everyone"
- Message goes to your default channel

### Refreshing Channel List

The app **automatically fetches fresh channels** every time you send a message, so new channels work immediately without manual refresh!

You can also manually refresh:
- Click "Refresh Channels" button on homepage
- Or re-authenticate to get latest channels

### Switching Workspaces

Click "Switch Workspace" to:
- Connect to a different Slack workspace
- Re-authenticate with new team
- Switch between multiple workspaces easily
