### Trigger Phrases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Supported Voice Triggers">
    - "Feedback Post"
    - "Create Issue"
    - "Report Issue"
    - "File Issue"
    - "New Issue"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How It Works

**The app intelligently collects and processes your feedback:**
1. Detects "Feedback Post" → Starts collecting
2. Automatically collects 5 segments (15-20 seconds of detailed speech)
3. Sends all segments to AI
4. AI generates professional title and detailed description
5. Creates GitHub issue with "voice-feedback" label
6. Notifies you with issue link! 🎉

<Note>
**Example Workflow:**

You: "Feedback Post, the search function isn't working"  
*[collecting silently...]*

You: "when I type in the search bar nothing happens"  
*[collecting silently...]*

You: "I've tried on both Chrome and Safari"  
*[collecting silently...]*

You: "and it worked fine last week but now"  
*[collecting silently...]*

You: "it's completely broken on all browsers"  
*→ AI processes all 5 segments*

**AI Generated Issue:**
- **Title:** "Search function not working across browsers"
- **Description:** The search function is currently not working. When typing in the search bar, no results appear. This issue has been tested on both Chrome and Safari browsers. The search functionality was working correctly last week but is now completely non-functional across all browsers.

→ Issue created! 🔔

## 🧠 AI Processing

The app uses OpenAI for intelligent issue generation:

1. **Collection** - Gathers 5 segments (~15-20 seconds) for detailed context
2. **Title Generation** - Creates concise, descriptive title
3. **Description Formatting** - Structures problem statement professionally
4. **Cleanup** - Removes filler words, fixes grammar, adds proper formatting

**Example Transformation:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Voice Input (5 segments)
"the app keeps crashing when I um try to upload photos 
it happens every single time on my iPhone 14 like 
the app just freezes for a second and then 
it completely closes and this started happening 
after the latest update yesterday"
```

```markdown AI-Generated GitHub Issue
Title: App crashes when uploading photos on iPhone 14

Description:
The app consistently crashes during photo uploads. When attempting to 
upload a photo, the app freezes briefly and then closes completely. 
This issue occurs every time on iPhone 14 and started after the latest 
update.

Labels: voice-feedback
```
</CodeGroup>

## 📊 How Segments Work

**OMI sends transcripts in segments** as you speak. The app:
- ✅ Detects "Feedback Post" trigger
- ✅ Collects exactly 5 segments
- ✅ Silent during collection (no spam)
- ✅ AI processes all 5 together
- ✅ One notification on completion

**Why 5 segments?**
- Allows detailed problem description
- Captures ~15-20 seconds of speech
- Gives context for better issue formatting
- AI has full information for title/description generation
