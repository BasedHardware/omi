## Features

- **Context-Aware Mentorship** - AI analyzes your conversations and provides timely insights
- **Smart Interruption Logic** - Only interrupts when you need meaningful guidance
- **Topic Extraction** - Automatically identifies key topics from your discussions
- **Personalized Advice** - Uses your facts, context, and chat history for tailored guidance

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the App">
    Install the OMI Mentor app in your OMI mobile app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Conversations">
    Have natural conversations while wearing your OMI device
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Insights">
    Get personalized mentorship when the AI detects you need guidance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Advice">
    Act on the specific, actionable recommendations provided
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How It Works

**The app intelligently monitors and analyzes your conversations:**
1. Listens to your conversations in real-time
2. Buffers messages and detects silence periods
3. Analyzes conversation context every 5 minutes
4. Extracts relevant topics using AI
5. Evaluates if mentorship is warranted
6. Sends personalized, direct advice when appropriate

<Note>
**Example Workflow:**

You: "I'm not sure if I should take this new job offer..."  
*[AI listens and analyzes conversation]*

Friend: "What's holding you back?"  
*[Continues collecting context]*

You: "The salary is better but I'd lose my work-life balance..."  
*[AI evaluates if intervention is needed]*

**AI Mentor Decision:**
- ✓ User is participating
- ✓ User expressed a specific challenge
- ✓ Has strong, clear opinion to share
- ✓ Insight is time-sensitive

**AI Sends:** "You just said work-life balance matters more than money. The answer's already clear - you're trying to convince yourself otherwise. What would you tell your best friend in this situation?"

→ Notification sent!
</Note>

## Using the App

### With OMI Device

1. Install the OMI Mentor app from the OMI App Store
2. Wear your OMI device during conversations
3. The AI monitors and analyzes in the background
4. Receive timely notifications with personalized advice
5. Implement the guidance provided

## AI Processing

The app uses OpenAI for intelligent mentorship:

1. **Topic Extraction** - Identifies key topics from conversations using GPT-4
2. **Context Analysis** - Evaluates user participation and expressed challenges
3. **Interruption Logic** - Determines if advice is warranted based on 4 criteria
4. **Personalized Guidance** - Generates direct, actionable advice using user context

**Interruption Criteria:**

<CodeGroup>
```text Requirements (ALL must be met)
1. User is actively participating in the conversation
2. User expressed a specific problem, challenge, goal, or question
3. AI has a STRONG, CLEAR opinion that would significantly impact the situation
4. The insight is time-sensitive and worth interrupting for
```

```text Response Style
- Speaks DIRECTLY to the user (no third-person analysis)
- Takes a clear stance (no "however" or "on the other hand")
- Under 300 characters
- Simple, everyday language
- References specific details from what user said
- Bold and direct advice
- Ends with a specific implementation question
```
</CodeGroup>

## How the Buffer System Works

**OMI Mentor uses an intelligent message buffering system:**
- Collects conversation segments continuously
- Detects silence periods (2+ minutes of inactivity)
- Requires minimum 5 words after silence to resume
- Clears old messages after silence to start fresh
- Analyzes buffered messages every 5 minutes
- Cleans up inactive sessions after 1 hour

**Smart Collection:**
- **Analysis Interval:** Every 5 minutes
- **Silence Threshold:** 2 minutes of no activity
- **Min Words to Resume:** 5 words after silence
- **Session Cleanup:** 1 hour of inactivity
- **Message Grouping:** Combines messages from same speaker within 2 seconds

## Personalization Features

### User Context Integration

The AI uses multiple sources to personalize advice:
- **User Facts** - Information about the user's preferences and history
- **User Context** - Previous discussions and ongoing situations
- **Chat History** - Past interactions with the mentor
- **Current Topics** - Automatically extracted conversation themes

### Topic-Based Filtering

Topics are automatically extracted and used to:
- Filter relevant historical context
- Match with user's interests and expertise
- Provide domain-specific guidance
- Connect current challenges with past experiences

## Privacy & Behavior

<Check>
**Privacy Features:**
- Only analyzes when you're actively speaking
- Doesn't interrupt every conversation
- Requires specific conditions before providing advice
- Clears messages after silence periods
- No persistent storage of conversation content
- Session-based processing with automatic cleanup
