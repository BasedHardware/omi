## What Are Prompt-Based Apps?

Prompt-based apps let you customize how Omi thinks and responds without writing any backend code. Simply define your prompt and Omi's behavior changes accordingly.

## Chat Prompts

Chat prompts alter Omi's conversational style and knowledge base. Create specialized versions of Omi for different contexts or expertise areas.

    U[User Message] --> O[Omi + Your Prompt]
    O --> R[Customized Response]

    style O fill:#e1f5fe
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Chat Prompts Work" icon="gear">
    When a user chats with Omi while your app is enabled:

    1. Your prompt is injected into the system context
    2. Omi adopts the personality/expertise you defined
    3. All responses reflect your customizations

    The prompt persists for the entire conversation, creating a consistent experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">
    - **Expert Personas**: Make Omi communicate like a historian, scientist, or creative writer
    - **Professional Advisors**: Create a fitness coach, financial advisor, or therapist persona
    - **Language Tutors**: Build a conversational partner for language learning
    - **Role-Playing**: Create characters for storytelling or gaming
    - **Domain Experts**: Specialized knowledge in cooking, gardening, coding, etc.

## Memory Prompts

Memory prompts analyze conversations and extract specific information based on your criteria. They run after each conversation is processed.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C[Conversation Ends] --> M[Memory Processing]
    M --> P[Your Prompt]
    P --> E[Extracted Information]

    style P fill:#e8f5e9
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Memory Prompts Work" icon="gear">
    After a conversation is transcribed and processed:

    1. The full transcript is passed to your prompt
    2. Your prompt extracts/summarizes specific information
    3. The result is saved alongside the conversation

    This creates structured data from unstructured conversations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Example Use Cases" icon="lightbulb">
    - **Action Items**: Extract to-do items and deadlines from meetings
    - **Key Decisions**: Identify and log important decisions made
    - **Meeting Notes**: Generate structured summaries
    - **Sentiment Analysis**: Track emotional tone of conversations
    - **Topic Extraction**: Categorize conversations by subject matter
    - **Quote Collection**: Pull notable quotes or insights
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Video Tutorial" icon="video">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Writing Effective Memory Prompts

<Tip>
Be specific about what to extract and how to format the output.
</Tip>

**Example - Action Item Extractor:**
```
Analyze this conversation and extract all action items.

For each action item, identify:
- The task description
- Who is responsible (if mentioned)
- Any deadline or timeframe mentioned
- Priority level (high/medium/low based on context)

Format as a numbered list. If no action items exist, respond with "No action items found."
```

**Example - Meeting Summary:**
```
Create a structured summary of this meeting:

1. **Attendees**: List people mentioned
2. **Main Topics**: Bullet points of key discussion areas
3. **Decisions Made**: Any conclusions or agreements
4. **Action Items**: Tasks assigned with owners
5. **Follow-ups**: Next steps or future meetings mentioned

Keep each section concise (2-3 sentences max).
```

## Combining Chat and Memory Prompts

<Info>
You can create apps with both chat AND memory prompts for comprehensive functionality.
</Info>

**Example - Project Manager App:**
- **Chat Prompt**: Acts as a project management assistant, helping plan tasks and track progress
- **Memory Prompt**: Extracts project updates, blockers, and timeline changes from conversations

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Vague prompts lead to inconsistent results. Define exact behaviors, formats, and constraints.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test Edge Cases" icon="flask">
    Try unusual inputs to ensure your prompt handles unexpected scenarios gracefully.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep It Focused" icon="compress">
    Single-purpose apps perform better than apps trying to do everything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iterate Quickly" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Start simple, test, and refine. Don't try to perfect the prompt on the first attempt.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Avoid prompts that could generate harmful, misleading, or inappropriate content. Apps violating community guidelines will be removed.
</Warning>
