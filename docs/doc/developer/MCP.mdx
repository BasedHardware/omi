title: "Model Context Protocol"
description: "A Model Context Protocol server for Omi interaction and automation. This server provides tools to read, search, and manipulate Memories and Conversations."
---

import { AccordionGroup, Accordion } from 'mintlify-components';

## Configuration

### API Key

To use the Omi MCP server, you need an API key. You can generate one in the Omi app under `Settings > Developer > MCP`. The API key can be provided with each tool call. If not provided, the server will use the `OMI_API_KEY` environment variable as a fallback.

### Usage with Claude Desktop

Add this to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

Install docker, https://orbstack.dev/ is great.

Replace `your_api_key_here` with the key you generated in the Omi app.

```json
"mcpServers": {
  "omi": {
    "command": "docker",
    "args": ["run", "--rm", "-i", "-e", "OMI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here", "omiai/mcp-server"]
  }
}
```

## Debugging

You can use the MCP inspector to debug the server. For uvx installations:

```
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uvx mcp-server-omi
```

Or if you've installed the package in a specific directory or are developing on it:

```
cd path/to/servers/src/omi
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run mcp-server-omi
```

Running `tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp-server-omi.log` will show the logs from the server and may
help you debug any issues.

## Advanced

### Custom Backend URL

If you are self-hosting the Omi backend, you can specify the API endpoint by setting the `OMI_API_BASE_URL` environment variable.

```bash
export OMI_API_BASE_URL="https://your-backend-url.com"
```
