title: 'One-Click Local Development Setup'
description: 'Run the entire Omi backend locally with Docker, no API keys required.'
---

This guide provides instructions for setting up the Omi backend locally using Docker Compose,
with mock services for external dependencies. This allows for a full-featured development
environment without needing to configure cloud API keys.

## Prerequisites

*   **Docker Desktop:** Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system.
    *   [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)
    *   [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
    *   [Install Docker for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)

## Setup

Navigate to the `backend/` directory within your Omi repository:

```bash
cd projects/omi/backend
```

### Linux / macOS

Run the setup script:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

### Windows (PowerShell)

Open PowerShell in the `backend/` directory and run the setup script:

```powershell
./setup.ps1
```

---

The setup script will:
1.  Check for Docker and Docker Compose.
2.  If `.env` doesn't exist, it will copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and generate secure random keys for `ADMIN_KEY` and `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`.
3.  Prompt you to edit `.env` to add required API keys for Deepgram and OpenAI (if you want to use real services).
4.  Build and start all Omi services using Docker Compose.

## Accessing Services

Once the services are up, you can access:

*   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
*   **Backend API:** `http://localhost:8080`
*   **Pusher Service:** `http://localhost:8081`

## Data Persistence

Local data (memories, tasks, etc.) for `MockFirestore` is persisted to `./data/backend/firestore_mock.json` on your host machine. Redis data is persisted to `./data/redis`. These volumes are managed by Docker.

## Managing Services

*   **View Logs:** `docker compose logs -f`
*   **Stop Services:** `docker compose down`
*   **Restart Services:** `docker compose restart`
