# 🎧 Omi Python SDK 

This SDK connects to an **Omi wearable device** over **Bluetooth**, decodes the **Opus-encoded audio**, and transcribes it in **real time using Deepgram**.

---

## ✅ Features

- 🔗 Real-time BLE connection to Omi
- 🔊 Opus audio decoding (16-bit, 16kHz mono)
- 🧠 Live transcription via Deepgram WebSocket
- 💻 Easy to run with just a few commands

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi.git
cd sdks/python

### 2. Set up Python environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


### 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


### ⚙️ 4. Configuration Set your Deepgram API key

# Get a free API key from https://deepgram.com, then run:
export DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_actual_deepgram_key

5. Find Omi’s MAC Address
To connect to your specific Omi device, you need its Bluetooth MAC address.

🔍 Scan for Nearby Bluetooth Devices
Run this command:
python -c "from omi.bluetooth import print_devices; print_devices()"
Look for a device named Omi, like this:

0. Omi [7F52EC55-50C9-D1B9-E8D7-19B83217C97D]
Copy the MAC address inside the brackets and paste it into main.py:

python
Copy code
OMI_MAC = "7F52EC55-50C9-D1B9-E8D7-19B83217C97D"


### 6. Confirm Omi Audio Characteristic (Optional)
You can verify the audio characteristic UUID by running:

python omi/discover_characteristics.py
You should see something like:


Characteristic UUID: 19B10001-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214
This UUID is already used in the code by default.

🏃 Run the SDK
Once configured, start the main script:
python main.py
✅ You should see:
Connected to Deepgram WebSocket
Connected to [Omi MAC Address]
DATA FROM OMI: ...
Transcript: hello world


### 🧩 Troubleshooting
✅ Make sure Omi is powered on and near your computer

✅ You must be using Python 3.10+

✅ If you see extra_headers error from websockets, fix it with:


pip install websockets==11.0.3
