## I. Setting Up Google Cloud & Firebase ☁️

1. **Install Google Cloud SDK:**
    - **Mac (using brew):** `brew install google-cloud-sdk`
    - **Nix Envdir:** The SDK is usually pre-installed
    - **Windows (using choco):** `choco install gcloudsdk`

2. **Enable Necessary APIs: 🔧**
    - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
    - Select your project
    - Navigate to APIs & Services -> Library
    - Enable the following APIs:
        - [Cloud Resource Manager API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com)
        - [Firebase Management API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/firebase.googleapis.com)

3. **Authenticate with Google Cloud: 🔐**
    - Open your terminal
    - Run the following commands one by one, replacing `<project-id>` with your Google Cloud project ID:
       ```bash
       gcloud auth login
       gcloud config set project <project-id>
       gcloud auth application-default login --project <project-id>
       ```
    - This process generates an `application_default_credentials.json` file in the `~/.config/gcloud` directory. This file is used for automatic authentication with Google Cloud services in Python.
    - Copy the credentials file to your backend directory and rename it:
       ```bash
       # For macOS/Linux:
       cp ~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json ./google-credentials.json

       # For Windows:
       copy %APPDATA%\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json google-credentials.json
       ```


## II. Backend Setup 🛠️

1. **Install Python & Dependencies: 🐍**
    - **Mac (using brew):** `brew install python`
    - **Nix Envdir:** Python is pre-installed
    - **Windows (using choco):** `choco install python`
    - **Install pip (if not present):**
        - Follow instructions on [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
    - **Install Git and FFmpeg:**
        - **Mac (using brew):** `brew install git ffmpeg`
        - **Nix Envdir:** Git and FFmpeg are pre-installed
        - **Windows (using choco):** `choco install git.install ffmpeg`
    - **Install opus:**
        - **Mac (using brew):** `brew install opus`
        - **Windows:** You should already have it installed if you are on Windows 10 version 1903 and above
    - **Install PyOgg:**
        - **All Platforms:** `pip install PyOgg`
    - **Install All Required Dependencies:**
        - **All Platforms:** `brew install -r requirements.txt`

2. **Clone the Backend Repository: 📂**
    - Open your terminal and navigate to your desired directory
    - Clone the Omi backend repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/Omi.git
       cd Omi
       cd backend
       ```

3. **Set up Pusher Service: 📡 [Optional]**
    - You don't need to have the Pusher Service running if you do not intend to use the webhooks feature
    - Navigate to the pusher directory:
       ```bash
       cd pusher
       ```
    - Create a copy of the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`:
      ```bash
      cp .env.template .env
      ```
    - Set the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` environment variable in the `.env` file to the string representation of your Google Cloud service account credentials (`google-credentials.json`). This is used to authenticate with Google Cloud
    - Move back to the backend directory and run the following command to start the Pusher service:
       ```bash
       uvicorn pusher.main:app --reload --env-file .env --port 8000
       ```
    - Optionally you can expose the Pusher endpoint using Ngrok or a similar service

4. **Set up Typesense: 🔎 [Optional]**
    - You don't need to setup Typesense if you do not intend to use the search functionality
    - Create an account on [Typesense](https://typesense.org/)
    - Create a new collection in Typesense with the name `memories` and use the schema provided in the `typesense/memories.schema` file
    - Install the Firebase Typesense extension from [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/_/extensions/install?ref=typesense/firestore-typesense-search@2.0.0-rc.1)
      - While setting up the extension, use the following values for the configuration:
        - Firestore Collection Path: `users/{userId}/memories`
        - Firestore Collection Fields: `structured,transcript_segments,created_at,deleted,discarded,started_at,id,finished_at,geolocation,userId`
      - Create `typesense_sync` collection and add a document named `backfill` with data `{'trigger' : true}` (required only if you already have memories in Firestore and want to sync them to Typesense)
    - Set the `TYPESENSE_HOST`, `TYPESENSE_HOST_PORT` and `TYPESENSE_API_KEY` environment variables in the `.env` file to the host URL and API key provided by Typesense


5. **Set up the Environment File: 📝**
    - Create a copy of the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`:
      ```bash
      cp .env.template .env
      ```
    - Open the `.env` file and fill in the following:
        - **OPENAI_API_KEY:** Obtained from your [OpenAI API Settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys)
        - **DEEPGRAM_API_KEY:** Obtained from your [Deepgram Console](https://console.deepgram.com/api-keys)
        - **Redis Credentials:**  Host, port, username, and password from your [Upstash Redis Console](https://console.upstash.com/)
        - **Modal API Key:**  Obtained from your [Modal Dashboard](https://modal.com/settings#tokens)
        - **ADMIN_KEY:** Set to a temporary value (e.g., `123`) for local development
        - **ENCRYPTION_SECRET:** The `.env.template` provides a default key suitable for local development (e.g., `omi_ZwB2ZNqB2HHpMK6wStk7sTpavJiPTFg7gXUHnc4tFABPU6pZ2c2DKgehtfgi4RZv`). For production, you must generate a new secure key.
        - **HOSTED_PUSHER_API_URL:** Endpoint of your hosted pusher service (if you are using it, see step 3)
        - **Typesense Credentials:** Host, port, and API key from your [Typesense Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.typesense.org/clusters)
        - **NO_SOCKET_TIMEOUT: (Optional)** Set to `True` to disable the socket timeout for the backend server (socket will stay connected for as long as the app is open)
        - **Other API Keys:** Fill in any other API keys required by your integrations (e.g., [Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/google/maps-apis/credentials))

6. **Install Python Dependencies: 📚**
    You have two options for installing the required Python packages:

    **Option A: Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended) 🐍**
    - It's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies and avoid conflicts
    - Create a new virtual environment in the backend directory:
      ```bash
      # Create a new virtual environment
      python -m venv venv

      # Activate the virtual environment
      # On Windows:
      venv\Scripts\activate
      # On macOS/Linux:
      source venv/bin/activate
      ```
    - You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your command prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active
    - Install dependencies within the virtual environment:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - All packages will be installed isolated from your system's Python installation

    **Option B: Direct Installation**
    - If you prefer not to use a virtual environment, you can install the dependencies directly:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```
    - Note that this approach may lead to conflicts with other Python projects on your system

7. **Code Formatting: 💅**
    - To maintain code quality, we use `black` for formatting with a line length of 120 characters.
    - You must have `black` installed:
      ```bash
      pip install black
      ```
    - To automatically format your code on commit, install the pre-commit hook from the repository root:
      ```bash
      # From the root of the repository
      ln -s -f ../../scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
      ```

## III. Running the Backend Locally 🏃‍♂️

1. **Set up Ngrok for Tunneling: 🚇**
    - Sign up for a free account on [https://ngrok.com/](https://ngrok.com/) and install Ngrok
    - Follow their instructions to authenticate Ngrok with your account
    - During the onboarding, Ngrok will provide you with a command to create a tunnel to your localhost. Modify the port in the command to `8000` (the default port for the backend). For example:
      ```bash
      ngrok http --domain=example.ngrok-free.app 8000
      ```
    - Run this command in your terminal. Ngrok will provide you with a public URL (like `https://example.ngrok-free.app`) that points to your local backend

2. **Start the Backend Server: 🖥️**
    - In your terminal, run:
      ```bash
      uvicorn main:app --reload --env-file .env
      ```
        - `--reload` automatically restarts the server when code changes are saved, making development easier
        - `--env-file .env` loads environment variables from your `.env` file
        - `--host 0.0.0.0` listens to every interface on your computer so you don't have to set up `ngrok` when developing in your network
        -  `--port 8000` port for backend to listen

3. **Troubleshooting SSL Errors: 🔒**
    - **SSL Errors:** If you encounter SSL certificate errors during model downloads, add this to `utils/stt/vad.py`:
      ```python
      import ssl
      ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context
      ```
    - **API Key Issues:** Double-check all API keys in your `.env` file. Ensure there are no trailing spaces
    - **Ngrok Connection:** Ensure your Ngrok tunnel is active and the URL is correctly set in the Omi app
    - **Dependencies:** If you encounter any module not found errors, try reinstalling dependencies:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade --force-reinstall
      ```

4. **Connect the App to the Backend: 🔗**
    - In your Omi app's environment variables, set the `API_BASE_URL` to the public URL provided by Ngrok (e.g., `https://example.ngrok-free.app/`) (don't forget the trailing / )

Now, your Omi app should be successfully connected to the locally running backend.

5. **When You're Done: 🛑**
    - If you used a virtual environment, when you're finished working with the backend, deactivate it by running:
      ```bash
      deactivate
      ```
    - This command returns you to your system's global Python environment
    - To reactivate the virtual environment later, just run the activation command again (`source venv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows)

## Environment Variables 🔐

Here's a detailed explanation of each environment variable you need to define in your `.env` file:

- **`HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN`:** Your [Hugging Face Hub API token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens), used to download models for speech processing (like voice activity detection)
- **`BUCKET_SPEECH_PROFILES`:**  The name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket where user speech profiles are stored
- **`BUCKET_PLUGIN_LOGOS`:** The name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket where to put logos for uploaded apps
- **`BUCKET_BACKUPS`:** The name of the Google Cloud Storage bucket used for backups (if applicable)
- **`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`:**  The path to your [Google Cloud service account credentials file](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts) (`google-credentials.json`). This is generated in step 3 of **I. Setting Up Google Cloud & Firebase**
  - By default, the backend expects to find a file named `google-credentials.json` in the same directory where the application is running
  - If you've followed Option 1 in step 3 of the Google Cloud setup, this will be already set correctly
  - If you prefer to use the default location of the credentials, set this to the full path of your `application_default_credentials.json` file (e.g., `~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json` on macOS/Linux or `%APPDATA%\gcloud\application_default_credentials.json` on Windows)
- **`PINECONE_API_KEY`:** Your [Pinecone API key](https://app.pinecone.io/organizations/-/projects/-/api-keys), used for vector database operations. Storing Memory Embeddings: Each memory is converted into a numerical representation (embedding). Pinecone efficiently stores these embeddings and allows Omi to quickly find the most relevant memories related to a user's query
- **`PINECONE_INDEX_NAME`:** The name of your Pinecone index where memory embeddings are stored
- **`REDIS_DB_HOST`:** The host address of your Redis instance
- **`REDIS_DB_PORT`:** The port number of your Redis instance
- **`REDIS_DB_PASSWORD`:** The password for your Redis instance (blank by default)
- **`DEEPGRAM_API_KEY`:** Your [Deepgram API key](https://console.deepgram.com/api-keys), used for real-time and pre-recorded audio transcription
- **`ADMIN_KEY`:** A temporary key used for authentication during local development (replace with a more secure method in production)
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`:** Your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys), used for accessing OpenAI's language models for chat, memory processing, and more
- **`ENCRYPTION_SECRET`:** A secret key used to encrypt sensitive user data, such as conversations, memories, and chat messages. The key must be at least 32 bytes long. The `.env.template` file includes a default key (e.g., `omi_ZwB2ZNqB2HHpMK6wStk7sTpavJiPTFg7gXUHnc4tFABPU6pZ2c2DKgehtfgi4RZv`) which is sufficient for local development. **For a production environment, it is crucial to replace this with your own securely generated random string.**
- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`:** Your [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens), used to access GitHub's API for retrieving the latest firmware version
- **`WORKFLOW_API_KEY`:** Your custom API key for securing communication with external workflows or integrations
- **`HOSTED_PUSHER_API_URL`:** URL of your omi-pusher service if you're using one. Example: http://omi-push:8081
- **`TYPESENSE_HOST`:** URL of your typesense server. 
- **`TYPESENSE_API_KEY`:** Typesense API key

Make sure to replace the placeholders (`<api-key>`, `<bucket-name>`, etc.) with your actual values.
