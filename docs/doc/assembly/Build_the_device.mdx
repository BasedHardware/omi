## Assembly Instructions[â€‹](#assembly-instructions "Direct link to Assembly Instructions")

### **Step 0: Prepare the Components**[â€‹](#step-0-prepare-the-components "Direct link to step-0-prepare-the-components")

1. Ensure you've purchased all required components from the [Buying Guide](https://docs.omi.me/docs/assembly/Buying_Guide).
2. Download and print the case using the provided `.stl` file: [Case Design](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/omi/hardware/triangle%20v1).
   * If you don't have access to a 3D printer, use a 3D printing service or check [Makerspace](https://makerspace.com/) for printing locations.
