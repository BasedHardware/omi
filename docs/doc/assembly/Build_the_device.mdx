## Assembly Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the Components">
    Gather all your parts: XIAO board, battery, switch, wires, and 3D printed case.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Cut the Black Wire">
    Cut the black wire approximately **2/3 inch (17mm)** from the base of the battery connector.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Strip the Wire Ends">
    Remove a small portion of insulation from both ends of the cut wire using a wire stripper.

    <Note>
    Use the **28 AWG** notch on your wire stripper for best results.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Solder the Components">
    Follow the soldering diagram to connect the battery to the board. The switch goes in-line with the black (ground) wire.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Manage the Wires">
    Twist the longer red wire gently to help organize it within the case.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Curl the Wire">
    Carefully curl the twisted wire and place it to the side to ensure it fits within the case.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Attach the Lid">
    Align the lid with the case using the ridges as a guide and snap it into place.
