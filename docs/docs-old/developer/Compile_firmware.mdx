# Compile Firmware

### Prefer a Pre-Built Firmware?

Navigate to [Flash Device](https://docs.omi.me/docs/get_started/Flash_device) to install a pre-built firmware version.

---

## Build Methods

There are two ways to build the Omi firmware:

1. **Docker-based build (Recommended)** - Easier, works across all platforms
2. **nRF Connect for VS Code** - Traditional method

---

## Option 1: Docker-Based Build (Recommended)

This method is recommended as it eliminates environment setup complexities and works consistently across all platforms.

### Prerequisites
1. [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed on your system
2. Git repository cloned to your local machine

### Building with Docker

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
chmod +x omi/firmware/firmware/build-docker.sh
./omi/firmware/firmware/build-docker.sh
```

The output files will be in `omi/firmware/firmware/build/docker_build/` directory.

For more detailed instructions, see the [Docker build readme](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/blob/main/omi/firmware/firmware/docker-readme.md).

## Option 2: Build with nRF Connect for VS Code

### Step 1: Set Up nRF Connect

Follow the tutorial in this video:
[How to Set Up nRF Connect](https://youtu.be/EAJdOqsL9m8)

You must use **nRF Connect** SDK and toolchain version `2.7.0` to compile the firmware.
Note that this is not the `latest` version of the NRF Connect toolchain or SDK.

### Step 2: Open the Firmware Application

1. Open **nRF Connect Extension** inside VS Code.
2. Click "Open an existing application" and navigate to the `firmware/firmware` folder in the root of this repository.

   <img
     src="/images/install_firmware_screenshot_2.png"
     alt="install_firmware_screenshot_2"
     width="75%"
   />

### Step 3: Add a Build Configuration

1.  In the application panel of the extension, click the **Add Build Configuration** icon. Choose a `CMake Preset` that matches your hardware.

    <img
      src="/images/build_configuration.png"
      alt="Build Configuration"
      width="75%"
    />

Board target should be:
xiao_ble/nrf52840/sense

2.  Scroll to the bottom and click "Build Configuration." This will start the nRFConnect SDK building your firmware file.
    A VSCode notification popup will notify you of the progress of your build.

     alt="Build Configuration"
     width="75%"
   />

### Step 4: Locate the Compiled Firmware

Once the build succeeds, you will find the `zephyr.uf2` file in the directory corresponding to the CMake preset you chose, for example `firmware/firmware/build/build_xiao_ble_sense_devkitv2-adafruit/zephyr/`.

---

## Flashing the Firmware

Regardless of which build method you used:

1. Follow the steps as described in [Flash Device](../get_started/Flash_device)
2. Use the generated `zephyr.uf2` file instead of downloading a pre-built firmware

---

## Congratulations!

You have successfully compiled and installed the firmware on your OMI device.
