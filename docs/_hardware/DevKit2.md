## Introduction

DevKit 2 builds on top of and expands the DevKit1 capabilities, while keeping the necklace form factor. It still runs on Xiao nRF52840, but adds 8GB onboard storage, and a speaker, and replaces the on/off switch with a programmable button. This enables the device to listen in standalone mode, although you still need to connect it to the Friend app for processing.

You can see the new device [announcement on X](https://twitter.com/kodjima33/status/1821324066651041837).
