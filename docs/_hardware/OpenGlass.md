## Introduction

OpenGlass DevKit is a small clip-on device you can attach to your glasses. It runs on Xiao ESp32S3 Sense platform, and features camera and microphone. The device also has a slot for an SD card, which is currently not utilized.

OpenGlass takes continuous photos and records audio, and sends the data to the app for processing. It expands the memories with pictures, and allows you to capture every moment, remember important people, and understand the world around you. The device is designed to be used with the same Friend companion app as the rest of the devices.
