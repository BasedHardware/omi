# Import Integrations

Integration apps with Imports allow your app to not just receive data from OMI but also perform specific Imports within the OMI ecosystem. This guide will walk you through creating apps that can perform Imports like creating memories, adding memories, and more.

## What Are Integration Imports?

Integration Imports are predefined capabilities that your app can perform within the OMI ecosystem. Unlike triggers (which respond to events), Imports allow your app to proactively create or modify data in OMI.

Currently supported Imports include:
- **Create Conversation**: Generate new conversations in the user's OMI account
- **Create Memories(Facts)**: Add specific memories (previously called facts) to the user's knowledge base
- **Read Conversations**: Access and read all conversations in the user's OMI account
- **Read Memories**: Access and read all memories in the user's knowledge base

## Prerequisites

Before building an integration with Imports, you should:
1. Understand the [basics of OMI app development](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/apps/Introduction/)
2. Be familiar with [integration apps](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/apps/Integrations/)
3. Have a server or endpoint that can make API requests to OMI

## Setting Up an Integration with Imports

### Step 1: Define Your App's Purpose ðŸŽ¯

Decide what Imports your app will perform and when. For example:
- Will your app create conversations based on external events?
- Will it respond to user interImports in your own service?
- Will it run on a schedule to create periodic conversations?

### Step 2: Create Your App in OMI

1. Open the OMI app on your device
2. Go to the Apps section and select "Create App"
3. Fill in the basic app information (name, description, etc.)
4. Under "App Capabilities", select "External Integration"
5. In the External Integration section, select "Imports"
6. Choose the specific Imports your app will perform (e.g., "Create conversations", "Create memories")

### Step 3: Generate API Keys

After creating your app, you'll need to generate API keys to authenticate your requests:

1. Go to your app's management page
2. Scroll down to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Create Key"
4. Copy and securely store the generated key - you won't be able to see it again!

## Implementing the Create Conversation Import

The Create Conversation Import allows your app to programmatically create new conversations in a user's OMI account.

### API Endpoint

To create a memory, make a POST request to:

```
POST https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/{app_id}/user/conversations?uid={user_id}
```

Where:
- `{app_id}` is your app's unique identifier
- `{user_id}` is the OMI user ID for whom you're creating the memory

### Authentication

Include your API key in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_your_api_key_here
```

> **Important**: The API key must be associated with the app specified in the URL path.

### Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "started_at": "2024-07-21T22:34:43.384323+00:00",
  "finished_at": "2024-07-21T22:35:43.384323+00:00",
  "text": "This is the full text content of the memory that will be processed.",
  "text_source": "audio_transcript",
  "text_source_spec": "phone_call",
  "language": "en",
  "geolocation": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

#### Required Fields:

- `text`: The full text content of the conversation

#### Optional Fields:

- `started_at`: When the conversation/event started (ISO 8601 format) - defaults to current time if not provided
- `finished_at`: When the conversation/event ended (ISO 8601 format) - defaults to started_at + 5 minutes if not provided
- `language`: Language code (e.g., "en" for English) - defaults to "en" if not provided
- `geolocation`: Location data for the conversation
  - `latitude`: Latitude coordinate
  - `longitude`: Longitude coordinate
- `text_source`: Source of the text content (options: "audio_transcript", "message", "other_text") - defaults to "audio_transcript"
- `text_source_spec`: Additional specification about the source (optional)

### Response

A successful request will return a 200 OK status with an empty response body:

```json
{}
```

The conversation will be created asynchronously in the user's account.

### Error Handling

Common error responses include:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request format
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid Authorization header
- `403 Forbidden`: Invalid API key, app not enabled for user, or app lacks create_conversation capability

- `{user_id}` is the OMI user ID for whom you're creating the facts

## Implementing the Read Conversations Import

The Read Conversations Import allows your app to programmatically access and read all conversations in a user's OMI account.

### API Endpoint

To read conversations, make a GET request to:

```
GET https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/{app_id}/conversations?uid={user_id}
```

Where:
- `{app_id}` is your app's unique identifier

## Best Practices

1. **User Consent**: Always ensure you have user consent before creating conversations or memories on their behalf
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting in your app to avoid hitting API limits
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API requests
4. **Data Quality**: Ensure the content is well-formatted and contains meaningful information
5. **Meaningful Content**: Only create memories and facts with meaningful content that provides value to users
6. **Verify App Enablement**: Check that users have enabled your app before attempting to create content
7. **Proper Authentication**: Securely store and use your API keys
8. **Structured Data**: When possible, provide well-structured data to improve the quality of extracted information

## Example Implementation

Here are examples showing how to create and read memories, facts, and conversations:

### Reading Conversations

#### Python Example

```python
import requests
import json

# API configuration
APP_ID = "your_app_id_here"
API_KEY = "sk_your_api_key_here"
USER_ID = "user_123"
API_URL = f"https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/{APP_ID}/conversations"

# Optional query parameters
params = {
    "limit": 50,
    "offset": 0,
    "include_discarded": False
}

# Make the API request
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {API_KEY}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

response = requests.get(
    f"{API_URL}?uid={USER_ID}",
    headers=headers,
    params=params
)

# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    conversations = response.json()["conversations"]
    print(f"Retrieved {len(conversations)} conversations")
    for conversation in conversations:
        print(f"Conversation ID: {conversation['id']}")
        print(f"Title: {conversation['structured']['title']}")
        print(f"Created at: {conversation['created_at']}")
        print("---")
else:
    print(f"Error retrieving conversations: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

##### cURL Example

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/your_app_id_here/conversations?uid=user_123&limit=50&offset=0" \

### Creating Memories

#### Example: Creating Memories from Different Sources

##### Python Example - Email Memories

```python
import requests
import json

# API configuration
APP_ID = "your_app_id_here"
API_KEY = "sk_your_api_key_here"
USER_ID = "user_123"
API_URL = f"https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/{APP_ID}/user/memories"

# Memories data from email
memories_data = {
    "text": "Your flight to Paris has been confirmed for May 15th, 2024. Departure: JFK at 9:30 PM. Arrival: CDG at 11:00 AM local time. Confirmation code: ABC123. Your hotel reservation at Hotel de Paris is confirmed for May 16-20, 2024.",

    f"{API_URL}?uid={USER_ID}",
    headers=headers,
    data=json.dumps(memories_data)
)

# Handle the response
if response.status_code == 200:
    print("Memories created successfully")
else:
    print(f"Error creating memories: {response.status_code}")
    print(response.text)
```

## Testing Your Integration

To test your integration:

1. Use a development API key
2. Create test conversations with clearly marked test content
3. Verify the conversations appear in the user's OMI app
4. Check that the structured data (title, overview, Import items) appears correctly

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication Errors**: Double-check your API key and ensure it's being sent correctly in the Authorization header
- **Invalid Request Format**: Validate your JSON against the required schema
- **App Not Found**: Verify your app ID is correct
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure your app has the create_conversation capability and is enabled for the user
- **Rate Limiting**: If you receive a 429 error, implement exponential backoff in your requests
- **Missing Required Fields**: Ensure you're providing `text`, `text_source`

## Prerequisites for Using Integration Imports

Before your app can use integration Imports, several conditions must be met:

1. **App Configuration**: Your app must be configured with the "External Integration" capability and specifically have the appropriate Import enabled:
   - For creating conversations: the "create_conversation" Import
   - For creating memories: the "create_memories" Import
   - For reading conversations: the "read_conversations" Import
   - For reading memories: the "read_memories" Import

2. **API Key**: You must generate an API key for your app through the app management interface.

3. **User Enablement**: The user must have explicitly enabled your app in their OMI account.

4. **Authorization**: Your API requests must include the proper Authorization header with your API key.

If any of these conditions are not met, the API will return appropriate error responses.

## Future Imports

The OMI team is continuously working to expand the available Imports. Future Imports may include:
- Updating existing conversations
- Updating existing memories
- Setting reminders
- Accessing and updating user preferences
- And more!

Stay tuned to the documentation for updates on new Import capabilities.

## Submitting Your App

Once your integration with Imports is ready:

1. Test thoroughly with real-world scenarios
2. Create clear setup instructions for users
3. Submit your app through the OMI mobile app
4. Include details about what Imports your app performs and when

For more details on the submission process, see the [Submitting Apps](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/apps/Submitting/) guide.

## Example Use Cases

Here are some inspiring examples of what you can build with integration Imports:

1. **Journal Creator**: Automatically create conversation entries based on data from a journaling app
2. **Meeting Summarizer**: Create conversations with structured summaries after calendar meetings
3. **Health Tracker**: Generate conversations with health insights based on fitness tracker data
4. **Social Media Archiver**: Create conversations from important social media interImports
5. **Learning Assistant**: Create structured conversations from educational content consumption
6. **Preference Tracker**: Extract memories about user preferences from emails or messages
7. **Knowledge Base Builder**: Create memories from educational content or research materials
8. **Contact Information Manager**: Extract contact details as memories from emails or messages
9. **Personal Analytics Dashboard**: Read and analyze conversations and memories to provide insights
10. **Memory Search Tool**: Create a specialized search interface for user memories
11. **Conversation Visualizer**: Generate visual representations of conversation patterns and topics
12. **Cross-Platform Sync**: Read conversations from OMI and sync them with other platforms

We can't wait to see what you build with OMI integration Imports!
