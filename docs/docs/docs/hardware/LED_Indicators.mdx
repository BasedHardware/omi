# LED Status Indicators

Omi devices use LED indicators to communicate device status. This guide will help you understand what different LED colors and patterns mean.

## General Status Indicators

| LED Pattern | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Blue solid** | Device is connected to a phone via Bluetooth |
| **Red solid** | Device is recording but not connected to a phone |
| **Green blinking** (while charging) | Battery is charging |
| **Green solid** (while charging) | Battery is fully charged (100%) |
| **Red blinking** | Battery is low (below 20%) |
| **Red-Green-Blue sequence** | Boot sequence, device is starting up |

## Checking Battery Level (Double-Tap)

You can check your battery level at any time by double-tapping the device button. The device will display the battery level through LED blinks.

### Battery Level Indication

When you double-tap the button, the device will display the battery percentage through a color-coded LED sequence:

#### For battery levels below 20%
- **Fast red blinking** for 3 seconds

#### For battery levels between 21% and 65%
- **Red LED blinks**:
  - 1 blink: 21-30%
  - 2 blinks: 31-40%
  - 3 blinks: 41-50%

#### For battery levels between 51% and 80%
- **Yellow LED blinks** (red and green LEDs together):
  - 1 blink: 51-60%
  - 2 blinks: 61-70%
  - 3 blinks: 71-80%

#### For battery levels above 80%
- **Green LED blinks**:
  - 1 blink: 81-90%
  - 2 blinks: 91-99%
  - Solid green for 3 seconds: 100%

## Note About Battery Charging

The device may stop charging at 95-96% to extend battery life. This is by design and helps preserve the long-term health of your battery.

## Button Functions

| Button Action | Function |
|---------------|----------|
| **Single tap** | Enter sleep mode / wake from sleep |
| **Double tap** | Show battery level |
| **Long press** | Reserved for future functions |

## Troubleshooting LED Patterns

If you see unusual LED patterns:

- **Alternating red and blue rapidly**: There may be a connectivity issue
- **All LEDs flashing simultaneously**: May indicate a firmware or hardware error
- **No LED response when pressing button**: Battery may be completely depleted

For any persistent issues, please contact support or check the troubleshooting section in the documentation.
