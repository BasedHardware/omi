# Create internal Application Load Balancer for connections between Cloud Run services in private networking

This guide will walk you through setting up an internal ALB to connect Cloud Run services (backend to pusher) internally inside VPC network.

## Create new VPC and subnet with Private Google Access is on
Choose VPC Network > VPC Networks > Create VPC Network

- VPC name: omi-dev-vpc-1

- Subnet: 
   - Name: omi-us-central1-dev-vpc-1-subnet-1 
   - Network: 172.16.16.0/20

Create Reserved proxy-only subnets for load balancing
- Name: pusher-lb-subnet-dev
- Network: 172.16.32.0/20

Make sure Private Google Access option is on

## Create internal Application Load Balancer

Choose Network services > Load Balancing > Create Load Balancer

- Type: Application Load Balancer (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Internal
- Best for regional workloads
- LB name: pusher-lb-dev
- Network: omi-dev-vpc-1
- Backend configuration:
   - Name: pusher-service-dev
   - Backend type: CloudRun
   - Serverless network endpoint group: pusher-ep-group-dev

- Frontend configuration:
   - Name: pusher-ep-dev
   - Protocol: HTTP
   - New Frontend IP and port
   - IP address: Ephemeral (Custom) - 172.16.16.250
   - Service label: internal-alb

Get internal ALB DNS name for later use

## Change network config for pusher and backend in Cloud Run
- pusher:
   - Cloud Run > pusher > Networking > Ingress Control: Internal and Allow traffic from external Application Load Balancers

- backend:
   - Cloud Run > backend > Edit and deploy new revision
   - Networking:
      Choose Connect to a VPC for outbound traffic
      - Send traffic directly to a VPC
      - Route only requests to private IPs to the VPC
   - Variable and servers:
      - HOSTED_PUSHER_API_URL: internal ALB DNS name
