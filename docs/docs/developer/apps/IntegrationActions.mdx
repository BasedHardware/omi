# Integration with Actions

Integration apps with actions allow your app to not just receive data from OMI but also perform specific actions within the OMI ecosystem. This guide will walk you through creating apps that can perform actions like creating memories and more.

## What Are Integration Actions?

Integration actions are predefined capabilities that your app can perform within the OMI ecosystem. Unlike triggers (which respond to events), actions allow your app to proactively create or modify data in OMI.

Currently supported actions include:
- **Create Memory**: Generate new memories in the user's OMI account

## Prerequisites

Before building an integration with actions, you should:
1. Understand the [basics of OMI app development](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/apps/Introduction/)
2. Be familiar with [integration apps](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/apps/Integrations/)
3. Have a server or endpoint that can make API requests to OMI

## Setting Up an Integration with Actions

### Step 1: Define Your App's Purpose ðŸŽ¯

Decide what actions your app will perform and when. For example:
- Will your app create memories based on external events?
- Will it respond to user interactions in your own service?
- Will it run on a schedule to create periodic memories?

### Step 2: Create Your App in OMI

1. Open the OMI app on your device
2. Go to the Apps section and select "Create App"
3. Fill in the basic app information (name, description, etc.)
4. Under "App Capabilities", select "External Integration"
5. In the External Integration section, select "Actions"
6. Choose the specific actions your app will perform (e.g., "Create memories")

### Step 3: Generate API Keys

After creating your app, you'll need to generate API keys to authenticate your requests:

1. Go to your app's management page
2. Scroll down to the "API Keys" section
3. Click "Create Key"
4. Copy and securely store the generated key - you won't be able to see it again!

## Implementing the Create Memory Action

The Create Memory action allows your app to programmatically create new memories in a user's OMI account.

### API Endpoint

To create a memory, make a POST request to:

```
POST https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/{app_id}/user/memories?uid={user_id}
```

Where:
- `{app_id}` is your app's unique identifier
- `{user_id}` is the OMI user ID for whom you're creating the memory

### Authentication

Include your API key in the request headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer sk_your_api_key_here
```

> **Important**: The API key must be associated with the app specified in the URL path.

### Request Body

The request body should be a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "started_at": "2024-07-21T22:34:43.384323+00:00",
  "finished_at": "2024-07-21T22:35:43.384323+00:00",
  "text": "This is the full text content of the memory that will be processed.",
  "text_source": "audio_transcript",
  "text_source_spec": "phone_call",
  "language": "en",
  "geolocation": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

The API supports two different formats for creating memories:

1. **Text-based format** (shown above): Provide a single text field with the content
2. **Transcript segments format**: Provide structured conversation segments

For the transcript segments format, use this structure instead:

```json
{
  "started_at": "2024-07-21T22:34:43.384323+00:00",
  "finished_at": "2024-07-21T22:35:43.384323+00:00",
  "transcript_segments": [
    {
      "text": "Segment text",
      "speaker": "SPEAKER_00",
      "speakerId": 0,
      "is_user": false,
      "start": 10.0,
      "end": 20.0
    }
    // More segments...
  ],
  "language": "en",
  "geolocation": {
    "latitude": 37.7749,
    "longitude": -122.4194
  }
}
```

#### Required Fields:

For text-based format:
- `text`: The full text content of the memory

For transcript segments format:
- `transcript_segments`: Array of conversation segments with at least one segment

#### Optional Fields:

Common optional fields:
- `started_at`: When the conversation/event started (ISO 8601 format) - defaults to current time if not provided
- `finished_at`: When the conversation/event ended (ISO 8601 format) - defaults to started_at + 5 minutes if not provided
- `language`: Language code (e.g., "en" for English) - defaults to "en" if not provided
- `geolocation`: Location data for the memory
  - `latitude`: Latitude coordinate
  - `longitude`: Longitude coordinate

Text-based format specific:
- `text_source`: Source of the text content (options: "audio_transcript", "email", "post", "message", "other_text") - defaults to "audio_transcript"
- `text_source_spec`: Additional specification about the source (optional)

### Response

A successful request will return a 200 OK status with an empty response body:

```json
{}
```

The memory will be created asynchronously in the user's account.

### Error Handling

Common error responses include:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request format
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid Authorization header
- `403 Forbidden`: Invalid API key, app not enabled for user, or app lacks create_memory capability
- `404 Not Found`: App not found
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded

## Best Practices

1. **User Consent**: Always ensure you have user consent before creating memories on their behalf
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting in your app to avoid hitting API limits
3. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for API requests
4. **Data Quality**: Ensure the transcript segments are well-formatted and make sense as a conversation
5. **Meaningful Content**: Only create memories with meaningful content that provides value to users
6. **Verify App Enablement**: Check that users have enabled your app before attempting to create memories
7. **Proper Authentication**: Securely store and use your API keys
8. **Structured Data**: When possible, provide well-structured data to improve the memory quality

## Example Implementation

Here are examples showing different ways to create memories using various text sources:

### Example 1: Email Memory

```python
import requests
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# API configuration
APP_ID = "your_app_id_here"
API_KEY = "sk_your_api_key_here"
USER_ID = "user_123"
API_URL = f"https://api.omi.me/v2/integrations/{APP_ID}/user/memories"

# Email memory data
email_memory = {
    "started_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    "finished_at": datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
    "language": "en",
    "text": """From: sarah@example.com
To: me@example.com

## Testing Your Integration

To test your integration:

1. Use a development API key
2. Create test memories with clearly marked test content
3. Verify the memories appear in the user's OMI app
4. Check that the structured data (title, overview, action items) appears correctly

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication Errors**: Double-check your API key and ensure it's being sent correctly in the Authorization header
- **Invalid Request Format**: Validate your JSON against the required schema
- **App Not Found**: Verify your app ID is correct
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure your app has the create_memory capability and is enabled for the user
- **Rate Limiting**: If you receive a 429 error, implement exponential backoff in your requests
- **Missing Required Fields**: Ensure you're providing `text`, `text_source`

## Prerequisites for Using the Create Memory Action

Before your app can create memories, several conditions must be met:

1. **App Configuration**: Your app must be configured with the "External Integration" capability and specifically have the "create_memory" action enabled.

2. **API Key**: You must generate an API key for your app through the app management interface.

3. **User Enablement**: The user must have explicitly enabled your app in their OMI account.

4. **Authorization**: Your API requests must include the proper Authorization header with your API key.

If any of these conditions are not met, the API will return appropriate error responses.

## Future Actions

The OMI team is continuously working to expand the available actions. Future actions may include:
- Updating existing memories
- Creating and managing user facts
- Setting reminders
- Accessing and updating user preferences
- And more!

Stay tuned to the documentation for updates on new action capabilities.

## Submitting Your App

Once your integration with actions is ready:

1. Test thoroughly with real-world scenarios
2. Create clear setup instructions for users
3. Submit your app through the OMI mobile app
4. Include details about what actions your app performs and when

For more details on the submission process, see the [Submitting Apps](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/apps/Submitting/) guide.

## Example Use Cases

Here are some inspiring examples of what you can build with integration actions:

1. **Journal Creator**: Automatically create memory entries based on data from a journaling app
2. **Meeting Summarizer**: Create memories with structured summaries after calendar meetings
3. **Health Tracker**: Generate memories with health insights based on fitness tracker data
4. **Social Media Archiver**: Create memories from important social media interactions
5. **Learning Assistant**: Create structured memories from educational content consumption

We can't wait to see what you build with OMI integration actions!
