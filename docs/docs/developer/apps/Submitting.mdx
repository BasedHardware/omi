# Submitting Apps

To submit your app to the OMI community, go to [omi mobile app and submit](https://x.com/kodjima33/status/1854725658485965061) there.

Alternatively:
1. Fork the [OMI GitHub repository](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Omi).
2. Locate the `community-plugins.json` file in the repository.
3. Add your **app's JSON object** to the end of the array in this file.
4. Double-check the formatting of your JSON
   using [JSON Formatter & Validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) to ensure it's correctly formatted.
5. Commit your changes and create a pull request to the main OMI repository.

Your pull request should only contain the addition of your app's JSON to the `community-apps.json` file. Once
approved, your app will become available to the OMI community.

We approve apps on a weekly-basis. If there is anything wrong with the submission, we will specify in PR's comments.

Note: Ensure your app adheres to our community guidelines and doesn't contain any sensitive or private information
before submitting.

## Guidelines 📜

While we encourage creativity, please keep these light guidelines in mind:

1. 🤝 **Respect for All**: Avoid content promoting hate or discrimination.

2. 🍭 **All Ages Welcome**: Consider a general audience when creating apps.

3. 🔍 **Strive for Accuracy**: If providing facts, aim for correctness.

4. 🔒 **Privacy First**: Respect user data and obtain clear consent.

5. ⚖️ **Keep it Legal**: No facilitating illegal activities, please!

6. 🌟 **Community-Driven**: Let users decide what's valuable through their choices.

Remember, these are broad guidelines to allow for creativity. The OMI community will shape the app ecosystem
through their usage and feedback. When in doubt, ask the community! Let's build together! 🚀
