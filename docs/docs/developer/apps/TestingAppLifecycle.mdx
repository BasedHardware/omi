## App Uninstall Notifications

When a user uninstalls your app, Omi automatically sends a webhook notification to your service with an `app_uninstalled` event. This allows you to:

- Clean up user-specific data on your servers
- Cancel any active subscriptions or services
- Update your usage metrics
- Perform any other necessary cleanup actions

The webhook payload includes:

```json
{
  "event": "app_uninstalled",
  "uid": "user-id",
  "app_id": "your-app-id"
}
```

By properly handling app uninstall notifications, you ensure users' data is properly managed and avoid potential security issues with lingering access after app removal.
