# Developing Prompt-Based Apps for OMI

Prompt-based apps allow you to customize OMI's behavior and enhance its ability to process information. This guide
will walk you through creating both Chat Prompts and Memory Prompts.

## Types of Prompt-Based Apps

### 1. 💬 Chat Prompts

Chat prompts alter OMI's conversational style and knowledge base. They allow you to create specialized versions of
OMI for different contexts or expertise areas.

#### Example Use Case

Create a app that makes OMI communicate like a specific expert or professional in a given field, such as a
historian, scientist, or creative writer.

### 2. 🧠 Memory Prompts

Memory prompts analyze conversations and extract specific information based on predefined criteria. They're useful for
summarization, key point extraction, or identifying action items from discussions.

#### Example Use Case

Develop a app that extracts action items from a meeting transcript and compiles them into a to-do list.

Note: It's possible to create apps that combine both chat and memory capabilities for more comprehensive
functionality.

## Creating a Prompt-Based App

### Step 1: Define Your App

Decide whether you're creating a Chat Prompt, a Memory Prompt, or a combination of both, and outline its specific
purpose.

### Step 2: Write Your Prompt

Craft your prompt carefully. For Chat Prompts, focus on defining the personality and knowledge base. For Memory Prompts,
clearly specify the information to be extracted and how it should be formatted.

### Step 3: Test Your App

Before making your app public, it's crucial to test your app to ensure it behaves as expected.

#### For Memory Prompts:

1. Download the OMI app on your device.
2. Enable developer settings in the app.
3. Open a memory within the app.
4. Click in the top right corner (3 dots menu).
5. In the developer tools section, you can run your prompt to test its functionality.

#### For Chat Prompts:

Create a private app and use the bot normally.

### Step 4: Release Your App

Once you're satisfied with your app's performance, you'll need to change your apps visibility to public or submit your app if you haven't already. Your app should be reviewed within a week.
