As a developer, you can create app for Omi app, letting other people to use your apps and earn in the future.

## What Are OMI Apps?

OMI apps are modular extensions that augment the core functionality of the app. They can modify app's
behavior, analyze conversations, and connect with external services.

Apps enable:

- Customized AI personalities and knowledge bases
- Extraction of specific information from conversations
- Task automation and integration with third-party services
