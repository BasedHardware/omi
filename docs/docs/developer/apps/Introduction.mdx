Start speaking, you'll see Real-time transcript on [webhook.site ](https://webhook.site)





## What Are OMI Apps?

OMI apps are modular extensions that augment the core functionality of the app. They can modify app's
behavior, analyze conversations, and connect with external services.

Apps enable:

- Customized AI personalities and knowledge bases
- Extraction of specific information from conversations
- Task automation and integration with third-party services
- Real-time conversation analysis and insights

[//]: # (With apps, OMI can be transformed into specialized tools such as:)

[//]: # (- A personal productivity coach that extracts action items and updates task management systems)

[//]: # (- An expert in any field, providing specialized knowledge and advice)

[//]: # (- A real-time language translator and cultural advisor)

[//]: # (- A personal CRM that analyzes conversations and maintains relationship histories)

[//]: # (- A health and fitness tracker that interprets discussions about diet and exercise)

Apps allow developers to tap into OMI's conversational abilities and combine them with external data and services,
opening up a world of possibilities for AI-enhanced applications.

## App Types

### 1. Prompt-Based Apps: Customizing AI Behavior

These apps modify how OMI processes and responds to information:

| Type                  | Description                                                                          | Example                                                                                                | Example Video                                                                                            |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **💬 Chat Prompts**   | Alter OMI's conversational style and knowledge base.                              | Create a app that makes OMI communicate like a specific expert or professional in a given field. | [![Chat app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/k1XhccNDT94/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/k1XhccNDT94)   |
| **🧠 Memory Prompts** | Analyze conversations and extract specific information based on predefined criteria. | Use for summarization, key point extraction, or identifying action items from discussions.             | [![Memory app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y3ehX_ueQmE/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/Y3ehX_ueQmE) |

### 2. Integration Apps: Connecting OMI to External Systems

These apps allow OMI to interact with external services and process data in real-time:
