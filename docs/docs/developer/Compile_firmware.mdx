# Compile Firmware

### Prefer a Pre-Built Firmware?

Navigate to [Flash Device](https://docs.omi.me/docs/get_started/Flash_device) to install a pre-built firmware version.

---

## Build Your Own Firmware

### Step 1: Set Up nRF Connect

Follow the tutorial in this video:
[How to Set Up nRF Connect](https://youtu.be/EAJdOqsL9m8)

You must use **nRF Connect** SDK and toolchain version `2.7.0` to compile the firmware.
Note that this is not the `latest` version of the NRF Connect toolchain or SDK.

---

### Step 2: Open the Firmware Application

1. Open **nRF Connect Extension** inside VS Code.
2. Click "Open an existing application" and navigate to the `firmware/firmware` folder in the root of this repository.

     alt="install_firmware_screenshot_2"
     width="75%"
   />

---

### Step 3: Add a Build Configuration

1.  In the application panel of the extension, click the **Add Build Configuration** icon. Choose a `CMake Preset` that matches your hardware.

      alt="Build Configuration"
      width="75%"
    />

Board target shoud be:
xiao_ble/nrf52840/sense

2.  Scroll to the bottom and click "Build Configuration." This will start the nRFConnect SDK building your firmware file.
    A VSCode notification popup will notify you of the progress of your build.

   />

---

### Step 4: Locate the Compiled Firmware

Once the build succeeds, you will find the `zephyr.uf2` file in the directory corresponding to the CMake preset you chose, for example `firmware/firmware/build/build_xiao_ble_sense_devkitv2-adafruit/zephyr/`.

---

### Step 5: Flash the Firmware

Follow the steps as described [here](../get_started/Flash_device) using the generated file

---

## Congratulations!

You have successfully compiled and installed the firmware on your OMI device.
