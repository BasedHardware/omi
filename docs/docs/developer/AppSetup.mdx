Building the app automatically means setting up your environment to use Omi's Development backend. That makes it much easier for you to get started - with just one command\!

This is the best way to get started, make changes to the app, and build apps on Omi.

Alternatively, you can [build the app manually (see below)](#build-the-app-manually) - which allows you to use your own backend, etc.

**1. Fvm Setup:**
Ensure Flutter is installed via [FVM](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation). Do not use global Flutter or upgrade it.

```
dart pub global activate fvm

# install flutter 3.24.1
fvm install 3.24.1

# use flutter 3.24.1
fvm use 3.24.1


**2. Navigate to the  directory:**

```
cd app
```

**3. Build the app for iOS:**

```
bash setup.sh ios
```

Note: This works great for iOS simulators\! ðŸŽ‰ Want to run on your real device? Ping us on [Discord](https://discord.omi.me) - we'd love to help\! (Apple limits us to 100 dev devices)

**4. Build the app for Android:**

```
bash setup.sh android
```

**If you use windows run the following commands**

```
.\setup\scripts\setup.ps1
```


**4. Run app in simulator:**

Now that we've built the app, we can run it in the simulator. Open the app in Xcode (open folder `app/ios`) or Android Studio (open folder `app/android`) - then just hit the run button\!

Alternatively, run `flutter run --flavor dev` in terminal

## Build the app manually:[â€‹](#build-the-app-manually)

Manual setup is useful if you want to build the app with your own backend.

### 1. Flutter Setup
Ensure Flutter is installed via [FVM](https://fvm.app/docs/getting_started/installation) as shown in step 1.

Run the following to verify setup:

```
fvm flutter doctor -v
```

**Example output:**

```

**Notes:**
- Flutter version must be 3.24.1 on the stable channel, do not use global Flutter or upgrade it.

- Android SDK platform tools must be 35.0.0

- Ensure JDK version is 17 for Android builds. Set it explicitly:

- (On macos you can use the following command to set the jdk version)
```
fvm flutter config --jdk-dir /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```

- CocoaPods must be installed to run on iOS/macOS
- Android Studio and VS Code versions do not matter as long as fvm flutter is used for all commands

### 2. Get Flutter Dependencies[â€‹](#2-get-flutter-dependencies)

From within `app` directory, install flutter packages:

```
cd app 
fvm flutter pub get
```

### 3. Install iOS Pods[â€‹](#3-install-ios-pods)

Navigate to the iOS directory and install the CocoaPods dependencies:

```
cd ios
pod install 
pod repo update
```

### 4. Environment Configuration[â€‹](#4-environment-configuration)

Create `.env` using template `.env.template`, the env template has OPENAI_API_KEY, GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY which are optional.

```
cd ..
cat .env.template > .dev.env
```

### 5. API Keys[â€‹](#5-api-keys)

Add your API keys to the `.env` file. (Sentry is not needed)

- `API_BASE_URL` is your backend url. You can use our dev backend URL https://backend-dt5lrfkkoa-uc.a.run.app/ or Follow this guide to [install backend](https://docs.omi.me/docs/developer/backend/Backend_Setup)
- Be sure to include the trailing '/' or you'll get malformed URL's
- If you want to update this later on, you will need to delete the builds folder, and recreate the runner using dart.

### 6. Run Build Runner[â€‹](#6-run-build-runner)

Generate necessary files with Build Runner:

```
fvm dart pub run build_runner clean
fvm dart pub run build_runner build
```

### 7. Setup Firebase[â€‹](#7-setup-firebase)
- This step is mandatory for running the app, otherwise firebase related code needs to be removed from the app.
- Follow official [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) till Step 1
- If you want to use Apple login, first go and [create an identifier on the apple developer website](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list)
- Run the following command to register the prod flavor of the app. The command will prompt you to select `configuration type`; under it, select `Target` and then `Runner`
  - substitute your apple identifier with the IOS_BUNDLE_ID in the command below 
  ```
  flutterfire config --out=lib/firebase_options_prod.dart --ios-bundle-id=IOS_BUNDLE_ID --android-app-id=com.friend.ios --android-out=android/app/src/prod/  --ios-out=ios/Config/Prod/
  ```
- Similarly for dev environment

  ```
  flutterfire config --out=lib/firebase_options_dev.dart --ios-bundle-id=com.friend-app-with-wearable.ios12.develop --android-app-id=com.friend.ios.dev --android-out=android/app/src/dev/  --ios-out=ios/Config/Dev/
  ```
- Generate SHA1/SHA256 Keys for your Keystore and add them to Firebase. Follow the steps mentioned in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56091158) or the [Official Docs](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/9137403?hl=en). This is required for Firebase Auth through Google OAuth to work.

If you're facing auth issues running the app, enable Google/Apple sign-in in Firebase. Go to the Firebase console and select your project. In the left-hand menu, click on "Authentication." On the "Sign-in method" tab, scroll down to the "Sign-in providers" section. Click on the "Google" sign-in provider. Click the "Enable" switch to enable Google Sign-In for your Firebase project.

### 8. Run the App[â€‹](#8-run-the-app)

- Select your target device in Xcode or Android Studio.
- Run the app using `fvm flutter run -v --flavor dev`
- To generate a dev apk `fvm flutter build apk ---flavor dev`
