## Walkthrough

### Downloading the Firmware

1. Visit the [OMI GitHub releases](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/releases).
2. Download the latest firmware and bootloader `.uf2` files.  
   **Important:** Ensure you select the correct files for your device:
   - Developer Kit 2 firmware is **not** compatible with Developer Kit 1.

### Putting OMI into DFU Mode

1. Plug the OMI device into your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Locate the DFU Button:**
   - For Developer Kit 2, remove the lid to access the button which is labeled "RST"
     - <img
         src="/images/dk2_rst_button.jpeg"
         title="DFU Button Location, DevKit 2"
         width="300"
       />
   - For Developer Kit 1, see the image below for button location:
     - <img
         src="/images/dfu_dev_kit_reset_button.png"
         title="DFU Button Location, DevKit 1"
         width="300"
       />
3. **Prepare a Pin:** Use a small pin or similar tool to press the tiny button.
4. **Press the DFU Button Twice:** Quickly press the button twice in succession using the pin.
5. **Check for Recognition:** After pressing the button, your computer should recognize a new drive.
6. **Verify the Drive Name:** Look for a drive named `/Volumes/XIAO-SENSE` on your computer. This confirms the device is in DFU mode.

### Flashing the Firmware

1. Locate the `.uf2` files downloaded earlier.
2. Drag and drop the **bootloader** `.uf2` file onto the `/Volumes/XIAO-SENSE` drive.
   - The device will automatically eject itself after completing the bootloader flashing process.
3. Put the OMI device back into DFU mode by double-tapping the reset button.
4. Drag and drop the **firmware** `.uf2` file onto the `/Volumes/XIAO-SENSE` drive.
   - **Note:** If your computer reports the transfer was incomplete, it is likely still successful.

## Congratulations!

You have successfully flashed the latest firmware onto your OMI device.  
Enjoy the enhanced functionality and features of your updated OMI!
