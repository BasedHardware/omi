## Flash Your DevKit

To flash your DevKit, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Latest DevKit Firmware**
   - Go to [the Omi GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/releases).
   - Search for the release that includes **`Omi_DK`** in its name.
   - Download the `.uf2` files for the **DevKit** from the release’s “Assets.”

2. **Put the DevKit in Bootloader Mode**
   - Connect your DevKit via USB to your computer.
   - Press and hold the BOOT/RESET button (on your DevKit) while plugging in or resetting the board.
   - Your DevKit should now appear as a USB drive named something like `DEVKIT`.

3. **Copy the Firmware to the DevKit**
   - Drag and drop the **`.uf2`** file you downloaded onto the `DEVKIT` drive.
   - The DevKit will automatically restart, running the newly flashed firmware.

> **Note**: For additional documentation on updating your DevKit2 firmware, please see [Updating Your DevKit2 Firmware](https://help.omi.me/en/articles/9995941-updating-your-devkit2-firmware).

### Putting OMI into DFU Mode

1. Plug the OMI device into your computer using a USB cable.
2. **Locate the DFU Button:**
   - For Developer Kit 2, remove the lid to access the button which is labeled "RST"
     - <img
         src="/images/dk2_rst_button.jpeg"
         title="DFU Button Location, DevKit 2"
         width="300"
       />
   - For Developer Kit 1, see the image below for button location:
     - <img
         src="/images/dfu_dev_kit_reset_button.png"
         title="DFU Button Location, DevKit 1"
         width="300"
       />
3. **Prepare a Pin:** Use a small pin or similar tool to press the tiny button.
4. **Press the DFU Button Twice:** Quickly press the button twice in succession using the pin.
5. **Check for Recognition:** After pressing the button, your computer should recognize a new drive.
6. **Verify the Drive Name:** Look for a drive named `/Volumes/XIAO-SENSE` on your computer. This confirms the device is in DFU mode.

### Flashing the Firmware

1. Locate the `.uf2` files downloaded earlier.
2. Drag and drop the **bootloader** `.uf2` file onto the `/Volumes/XIAO-SENSE` drive.
   - The device will automatically eject itself after completing the bootloader flashing process.
3. Put the OMI device back into DFU mode by double-tapping the reset button.
4. Drag and drop the **firmware** `.uf2` file onto the `/Volumes/XIAO-SENSE` drive.
   - **Note:** If your computer reports the transfer was incomplete, it is likely still successful.
