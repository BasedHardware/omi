## The Flow of Information: From User Interaction to Memory 🌊

Let's trace the journey of a typical interaction with Omi, focusing on how audio recordings are transformed into lasting memories:

### A. User Initiates a Recording 🎤

1. **Recording Audio:** The user starts a recording session using the Omi app, capturing a conversation or their thoughts.

### B. Real-Time Transcription with Deepgram 🎧

2. **WebSocket Connection:** The Omi app establishes a real-time connection with the backend using WebSockets (at the `/listen` endpoint in `routers/transcribe.py`).
3. **Streaming Audio:** The app streams audio data continuously through the WebSocket to the backend.
4. **Deepgram Processing:** The backend forwards the audio data to the Deepgram API for real-time speech-to-text conversion.
5. **Transcription Results:** As Deepgram transcribes the audio, it sends results back to the backend.
6. **Live Feedback:** The backend relays these transcription results back to the Omi app, allowing for live transcription display as the user is speaking.

### C. Creating a Lasting Memory 💾

7. **API Request to `/v1/memories`:** When the conversation session ends, the Omi app sends a POST request to the `/v1/memories` endpoint in `routers/memories.py`.
8. **Data Formatting:** The request includes information about the start and end time of the recording, the language, optional geolocation data, and the transcribed text segments from Deepgram.
9. **Memory Creation (`routers/memories.py`):** The `create_memory` function in this file receives the request and performs basic validation on the data.
10. **Processing the Memory (`utils/memories/process_memory.py`):**
    - The `create_memory` function delegates the core memory processing logic to the `process_memory` function. This function is where the real magic happens!
    - **Structure Extraction:** OpenAI's powerful large language model (LLM) is used to analyze the transcript and extract key information, creating a structured representation of the memory. This
      includes:
        - `title`: A short, descriptive title.
        - `overview`: A concise summary of the main points.
        - `category`: A relevant category to organize memories (work, personal, etc.).
        - `action_items`: Any tasks or to-dos mentioned.
        - `events`: Events that might need to be added to a calendar.
    - **Embedding Generation:** The LLM is also used to create a vector embedding of the memory, capturing its semantic meaning for later retrieval.
    - **Plugin Execution:** If the user has enabled any plugins, relevant plugins are run to enrich the memory with additional insights, external actions, or other context-specific information.
    - **Storage in Firestore:** The fully processed memory, including the transcript, structured data, plugin results, and other metadata, is stored in Firebase Firestore (a NoSQL database) for
      persistence.
    - **Embedding Storage in Pinecone:** The memory embedding is sent to Pinecone, a vector database, to enable fast and efficient similarity searches later.

### D. Enhancing the Memory (Optional)

11. **Post-Processing:** The user can optionally trigger post-processing of the memory to improve the quality of the transcript. This involves:
    - Sending the audio to a more accurate transcription service (like WhisperX through a FAL.ai function).
    - Updating the memory in Firestore with the new transcript.
    - Re-generating the embedding to reflect the updated content.

## The Core Components: A Closer Look 🔎

### 5. `database/redis_db.py`: The Data Speedster 🚀

Redis is an in-memory data store known for its speed and efficiency. The `database/redis_db.py` module handles Omi's interactions with Redis, which is primarily used for caching, managing user
settings, and storing user speech profiles.

**Data Stored and Retrieved from Redis:**

- **User Speech Profiles:**
    - **Storage:** When a user uploads a speech profile, the raw audio data, along with its duration, is stored in Redis.
    - **Retrieval:** During real-time transcription or post-processing, the user's speech profile is retrieved from Redis to aid in speaker identification.
- **Enabled Plugins:**
    - **Storage:** A set of plugin IDs is stored for each user, representing the plugins they have enabled.
    - **Retrieval:** When processing a memory or handling a chat request, the backend checks Redis to see which plugins are enabled for the user.
- **Plugin Reviews:**
    - **Storage:** Reviews for each plugin (score, review text, date) are stored in Redis, organized by plugin ID and user ID.
    - **Retrieval:** When displaying plugin information, the backend retrieves reviews from Redis.
- **Cached User Names:**
    - **Storage:** User names are cached in Redis to avoid repeated lookups from Firebase.
    - **Retrieval:** The backend first checks Redis for a user's name before querying Firestore, improving performance.

**Key Functions:**

- `store_user_speech_profile`, `get_user_speech_profile`: For storing and retrieving speech profiles.
- `store_user_speech_profile_duration`, `get_user_speech_profile_duration`: For managing speech profile durations.
- `enable_plugin`, `disable_plugin`, `get_enabled_plugins`: For handling plugin enable/disable states.
- `get_plugin_reviews`: Retrieves reviews for a plugin.
- `cache_user_name`, `get_cached_user_name`: For caching user names.
  **Why Redis is Important:**

- **Performance:** Caching data in Redis significantly improves the backend's speed, as frequently accessed data can be retrieved from memory very quickly.
- **User Data Management:** Redis provides a flexible and efficient way to manage user-specific data, such as plugin preferences and speech profiles.
- **Real-time Features:** The low-latency nature of Redis makes it ideal for supporting real-time features like live transcription and instant plugin interactions.
- **Scalability:** As the number of users grows, Redis helps maintain performance by reducing the load on primary databases.

### 6. `routers/transcribe.py`: The Real-Time Transcription Engine 🎙️

This module is the powerhouse behind Omi's real-time transcription capabilities, allowing the app to convert spoken audio into text as the user is speaking. It leverages WebSockets for bidirectional
communication with the Omi app and Deepgram's speech-to-text API for accurate and efficient transcription.

#### 1. WebSocket Communication: The Lifeline of Real-Time Interactions 🔌

- **`/listen` Endpoint:** The Omi app initiates a WebSocket connection with the backend at the `/listen` endpoint, which is defined in the `websocket_endpoint` function of `routers/transcribe.py`.
- **Bidirectional Communication:** WebSockets enable a two-way communication channel, allowing:
    - The Omi app to stream audio data to the backend continuously.
    - The backend to send back transcribed text segments as they become available from Deepgram.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** This constant back-and-forth ensures that users see their words being transcribed in real-time, creating a more interactive and engaging experience.

#### 2. Deepgram Integration: Converting Speech to Text with Precision 🎧➡️📝

- **`process_audio_dg` Function:** The `process_audio_dg` function (found in `utils/stt/streaming.py`) manages the interaction with Deepgram.
- **Deepgram API:** The audio chunks streamed from the Omi app are sent to the Deepgram API for transcription. Deepgram's sophisticated speech recognition models process the audio and return text
  results.
- **Options Configuration:** The `process_audio_dg` function configures various Deepgram options, including:
    - `punctuate`: Automatically adds punctuation to the transcribed text.
    - `no_delay`: Minimizes latency for real-time feedback.
    - `language`: Sets the language for transcription.
    - `interim_results`: (Set to `False` in the code) Controls whether to send interim (partial) transcription results or only final results.
    - `diarize`: Enables speaker diarization (identifying different speakers in the audio).
    - `encoding`, `sample_rate`: Sets audio encoding and sample rate for compatibility with Deepgram.

#### 3. Transcription Flow: A Step-by-Step Breakdown 🌊

1. **App Streams Audio:** The Omi app captures audio from the user's device and continuously sends chunks of audio data through the WebSocket to the backend's `/listen` endpoint.
2. **Backend Receives and Forwards:** The backend's `websocket_endpoint` function receives the audio chunks and immediately forwards them to Deepgram using the `process_audio_dg` function.
3. **Deepgram Processes:** Deepgram's speech recognition models transcribe the audio data in real-time.
4. **Results Sent Back:** Deepgram sends the transcribed text segments back to the backend as they become available.
5. **Backend Relays to App:** The backend immediately sends these transcription results back to the Omi app over the WebSocket connection.
6. **App Displays Transcript:** The Omi app updates the user interface with the newly transcribed text, providing instant feedback.

#### 4. Key Considerations

- **Speaker Identification:** The code uses Deepgram's speaker diarization feature to identify different speakers in the audio. This information is included in the transcription results, allowing the
  app to display who said what.
- **User Speech Profile Integration:** If a user has uploaded a speech profile, the backend can use this information (retrieved from Redis or Google Cloud Storage) to improve the accuracy of speaker
  identification.
- **Latency Management:** Real-time transcription requires careful attention to latency to ensure a seamless user experience. The `no_delay` option in Deepgram and the efficient handling of data in
  the backend are essential for minimizing delays.
- **Error Handling:** The code includes error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle any issues that may occur during the WebSocket connection or Deepgram transcription process.

#### 5. Example Code Snippet (Simplified):

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, WebSocket

# ... other imports ...

router = APIRouter()


@router.websocket("/listen")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket, uid: str, language: str = 'en', ...):
    await websocket.accept()  # Accept the WebSocket connection

    # Start Deepgram transcription
    transcript_socket = await process_audio_dg(uid, websocket, language, ...)

    # Receive and process audio chunks from the app
    async for data in websocket.iter_bytes():
        transcript_socket.send(data)

        # ... other logic for speaker identification, error handling, etc. 
```

## Other Important Components 🧩

- **`routers/transcribe.py`:** Manages real-time audio transcription using Deepgram, sending the transcribed text back to the Omi app for display.
- **`routers/workflow.py`, `routers/screenpipe.py`:** Define API endpoints for external integrations to trigger memory creation.
