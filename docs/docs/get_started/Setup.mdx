### Build the app automatically

Building the app automatically means setting up your environment to use Omi's Development backend. That makes it much easier for you to get started - with just one command!

This is the best way to get started, make changes to the app, and build apps on Omi.

Alternatively, you can [build the app manually (see below)](#build-the-app-manually) - which allows you to use your own backend, etc.

**1. Navigate to the `app` directory:**
```
cd app
```

**2. Build the app for iOS:**
```
bash setup.sh ios
```

**3. Build the app for Android:**
```
bash setup.sh android
```

**4. Run app in simulator:**

Now that we've built the app, we can run it in the simulator.
Open the app in Xcode (open folder `app/ios`) or Android Studio (open folder `app/android`) - then just hit the run button!

### Build the app manually:

Setup manually is useful if you want to build the app to use your own backend. 

### 1. Upgrade Flutter
   Before proceeding, make sure your Flutter SDK is up to date:
   ```
   flutter upgrade
   ```

### 2. Get Flutter Dependencies
   From within `app` directory, install flutter packages:
   ```
   cd app
   flutter pub get
   ```

### 3. Install iOS Pods
   Navigate to the iOS directory and install the CocoaPods dependencies:
   ```
   cd ios
   pod install
   pod repo update
   ```

### 4. Environment Configuration
   Create `.env` using template `.env.template`
   ```
   cd ..
   cat .env.template > .dev.env
   ```

### 5. API Keys
   Add your API keys to the `.env` file. (Sentry is not needed)
   - `API_BASE_URL` is your backend url. Follow this guide to [install backend](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Omi/tree/main/backend)

### 6. Run Build Runner
   Generate necessary files with Build Runner:
   ```
   dart run build_runner build
   ```

### 7. Setup Firebase
   - Follow official [Firebase Docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup) till Step 1
   - Run the following command to register the prod flavor of the app. The command will prompt you to select `configuration type`; under it, select `Target` and then `Runner`
     ```
     flutterfire config --out=lib/firebase_options_prod.dart --ios-bundle-id=com.friend-app-with-wearable.ios12 --android-app-id=com.friend.ios --android-out=android/app/src/prod/  --ios-out=ios/Config/Prod/
     ```
   - Similarly for dev environment
     ```
     flutterfire config --out=lib/firebase_options_dev.dart --ios-bundle-id=com.friend-app-with-wearable.ios12.develop --android-app-id=com.friend.ios.dev --android-out=android/app/src/dev/  --ios-out=ios/Config/Dev/
     ```
   - Generate SHA1/SHA256 Keys for your Keystore and add them to Firebase. Follow the steps mentioned in this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56091158) or
     the [Official Docs](https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/9137403?hl=en). This is required for Firebase Auth through Google OAuth to work.

   If you're facing auth issues running the app, enable Google/Apple sign-in in Firebase. Go to the Firebase console and select your project. In the left-hand menu, click on "Authentication." On the "Sign-in method" tab, scroll down to the "Sign-in providers" section. Click on the "Google" sign-in provider. Click the "Enable" switch to enable Google Sign-In for your Firebase project.

### 8. Run the App
   - Select your target device in Xcode or Android Studio.
   - Run the app.
