You can integrate your Omi wearable and app with Zapier, and get access to 6000+ apps. The integration can be triggered when a new memory is created, or when external event happens, add to memory.

## Setup:

1. Download Omi (Omi):

   - [Appstore](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omi-ai-prev-friend/id6502156163)
   - [Google store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.friend.ios&hl=en_US)

2. Open the app and go to **Settings → Plugins** and scroll down to **Zapier**. Then activate the integration, and make sure to copy the secret key from the app (see step 5 in the screenshot above).

3. Now, go to our [Zap plugin on Zapier] (https://zapier.com/app/editor/new/omi-friend) and accept the beta-test link invite.

## Build your first Zap automation:

1. Go to Zapier and create a new Zap.
2. Choose **Omi** as the trigger app and sign in with the secret key you copied from the app in the setup stage above.
