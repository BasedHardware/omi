# Building the Device

Follow this step-by-step guide to build your own OMI device


## Assembly Instructions

### **Step 0: Prepare the Components**

1. Ensure you've purchased all required components from the [Buying Guide](https://docs.omi.me/docs/assembly/Buying_Guide).
2. Download and print the case using the provided `.stl` file: [Case Design](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/Friend/hardware/triangle%20v1).
   - If you don't have access to a 3D printer, use a 3D printing service or check [Makerspace](https://makerspace.com/) for printing locations.

---

### **Step 2: Strip the Wire Ends**

Remove a small portion of insulation from both ends of the cut wire using a wire stripper.
- Use the *28 AWG* notch for best results.
