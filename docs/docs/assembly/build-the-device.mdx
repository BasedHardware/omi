## Assembly Instructions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare the Components">
    1. Ensure you've purchased all required components from the [Buying Guide](https://docs.omi.me/docs/assembly/Buying_Guide).
    2. Download and print the case using the provided `.stl` file: [Case Design](https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi/tree/main/omi/hardware/triangle%20v1).
    * If you don't have access to a 3D printer, use a 3D printing service or check [Makerspace](https://makerspace.com/) for printing locations.
