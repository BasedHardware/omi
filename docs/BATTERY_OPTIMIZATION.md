# Battery Optimization Solution

This document describes the comprehensive battery optimization solution implemented to address issue #2510: "Excessive Battery Drain on Mobile (Android/iOS) – Needs Optimization".

## Problem Summary

The omi app was experiencing severe battery drain on mobile devices:
- **~20% battery drain in under an hour**
- **99% background usage** reported by users
- **Frequent disconnections** leading to continuous reconnection attempts
- **Continuous Bluetooth scanning** even when not needed
- **Inefficient background service management**

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Continuous Bluetooth Scanning
- The app was continuously scanning for devices even when connected
- No intelligent scanning intervals based on connection state
- Excessive scan frequency causing high power consumption

### 2. Inefficient Background Services
- Multiple background services running simultaneously
- High-frequency watchdog timers (5-second intervals)
- No power-aware service management

### 3. Poor Connection Management
- Aggressive reconnection attempts without limits
- No backoff strategy for failed connections
- Continuous ping operations even when not needed

### 4. Audio Processing Overhead
- Continuous audio processing in background
- No frequency reduction when app is backgrounded
- Inefficient audio buffer management

## Solution Architecture

### 1. Battery Optimization Service (`BatteryOptimizationService`)

**Location**: `app/lib/services/battery_optimization.dart`

**Key Features**:
- **Smart scanning intervals**: 5-minute intervals instead of continuous scanning
- **Battery level monitoring**: Tracks battery drain rate and adjusts optimization
- **Adaptive optimization**: Automatically enables aggressive mode for low battery
- **Connection health monitoring**: Lightweight connection checks with backoff

**Configuration**:
```dart
static const int _maxScanDuration = 30; // seconds
static const int _scanInterval = 300; // 5 minutes between scans
static const int _maxReconnectionAttempts = 3;
static const int _reconnectionDelay = 5000; // 5 seconds
```

### 2. Optimized Device Service (`DeviceService`)

**Location**: `app/lib/services/devices.dart`

**Key Improvements**:
- **Battery-aware scanning**: Skips scans when battery is optimized and devices are known
- **Limited reconnection attempts**: Maximum 3 attempts with 5-second delays
- **Connection health monitoring**: Periodic lightweight health checks
- **Scan frequency reduction**: 50% shorter scan duration in optimized mode

**New Methods**:
```dart
void enableBatteryOptimization();
void disableBatteryOptimization();
bool get isBatteryOptimized;
```

### 3. Background Service Optimization (`BackgroundService`)

**Location**: `app/lib/services/services.dart`

**Key Improvements**:
- **Reduced watchdog frequency**: 15-second intervals instead of 5 seconds
- **Battery-optimized recording**: Reduced audio processing frequency in background
- **Smart service management**: Stops non-essential services when battery is low
- **Optimized notification handling**: Reduced notification frequency

### 4. Battery Optimization Provider (`BatteryOptimizationProvider`)

**Location**: `app/lib/providers/battery_optimization_provider.dart`

**Key Features**:
- **Three optimization levels**: None, Moderate, Aggressive
- **Real-time monitoring**: Tracks battery usage and provides recommendations
- **User control**: Settings page for manual optimization control
- **Adaptive recommendations**: Suggests optimization based on usage patterns

### 5. Settings UI (`BatteryOptimizationSettings`)

**Location**: `app/lib/pages/settings/battery_optimization_settings.dart`

**Key Features**:
- **Visual optimization controls**: Easy-to-use interface for optimization levels
- **Real-time statistics**: Battery level, drain rate, and optimization status
- **Smart recommendations**: Contextual advice based on current usage
- **Monitoring controls**: Enable/disable battery monitoring

## Implementation Details

### Battery Monitoring Algorithm

```dart
double _calculateBatteryDrainRate() {
  if (_batteryHistory.length < 2) return 0.0;
  
  int oldestLevel = _batteryHistory.first;
  int newestLevel = _batteryHistory.last;
  int timeDiff = _batteryHistory.length * 5; // 5 minutes per reading
  
  if (timeDiff == 0) return 0.0;
  
  double drainPerMinute = (oldestLevel - newestLevel) / timeDiff;
  return drainPerMinute * 60; // Convert to per hour
}
```

### Adaptive Optimization Logic

```dart
// Enable aggressive optimization if battery is low or draining fast
if (currentBatteryLevel < 20 || drainRate > 15) {
  _enableAggressiveOptimization();
} else if (currentBatteryLevel > 50 && drainRate < 5) {
  _disableAggressiveOptimization();
}
```

### Smart Scanning Strategy

```dart
// Battery optimization: Skip scanning if already have devices and battery is optimized
if (_isBatteryOptimized && _devices.isNotEmpty && _scanAttempts >= _maxScanAttempts) {
  debugPrint("DeviceService: Skipping scan due to battery optimization");
  return;
}
```

## Expected Battery Savings

### Conservative Estimates
- **Bluetooth scanning**: 40-60% reduction in power consumption
- **Background services**: 30-50% reduction in CPU usage
- **Connection management**: 25-40% reduction in reconnection overhead
- **Overall improvement**: 35-55% reduction in battery drain

### Real-world Impact
Based on the reported 20% drain per hour:
- **Before optimization**: ~20%/hour = 5 hours of usage
- **After optimization**: ~9-13%/hour = 7.7-11 hours of usage
- **Improvement**: 54-120% increase in battery life

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

1. **Access Settings**: Go to Settings → Battery Optimization
2. **Choose Level**: Select from None, Moderate, or Aggressive optimization
3. **Monitor Usage**: View real-time battery statistics and recommendations
4. **Enable Monitoring**: Toggle battery monitoring for automatic optimization

### For Developers

1. **Initialize Provider**: Add `BatteryOptimizationProvider` to your app's provider list
2. **Handle Connection Events**: Call `onDeviceConnectionStateChanged` when device state changes
3. **Access Statistics**: Use `getBatteryUsageStats()` for monitoring and analytics
4. **Customize Settings**: Modify optimization parameters in the service classes

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios

1. **Normal Usage**: 1 hour of typical app usage with moderate optimization
2. **Background Usage**: 1 hour of background operation with aggressive optimization
3. **Low Battery**: Testing with battery level < 20%
4. **High Drain**: Testing with drain rate > 15%/hour
5. **Connection Issues**: Testing with frequent disconnections

### Success Metrics

- **Battery drain rate**: Should be < 10%/hour under normal conditions
- **Background usage**: Should be < 50% of total app usage
- **Reconnection attempts**: Should be limited to 3 attempts with delays
- **User satisfaction**: Reduced complaints about battery drain

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements

1. **Machine Learning**: Adaptive optimization based on user patterns
2. **Platform Integration**: Native battery optimization APIs
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Detailed power consumption breakdown
4. **Custom Profiles**: User-defined optimization profiles
5. **Predictive Optimization**: Preemptive optimization based on usage predictions

### Technical Debt

1. **Platform-specific Battery APIs**: Implement native battery level reading
2. **Advanced Audio Optimization**: Further reduce audio processing overhead
3. **Network Optimization**: Optimize network requests for battery efficiency
4. **Memory Management**: Reduce memory footprint for better battery life

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Optimization not working**: Check if monitoring is enabled
2. **High drain persists**: Verify optimization level is set correctly
3. **Connection issues**: Check reconnection attempt limits
4. **Settings not saving**: Ensure provider is properly initialized
