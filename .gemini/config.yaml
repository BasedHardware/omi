review_preferences:
  # minimum_severity: (string) Specifies the lowest severity level of issues to report.
  # Valid values: "critical", "high", "medium", "low".
  # Issues with severity lower than this threshold will not be included in the review.
  # Default: "low" (all issues are reported).
  minimum_severity: "high"

  # include_code_suggestions: (boolean) Determines whether to include inline code suggestions
  # in the review comments. If set to `false`, I will describe issues but not provide
  # specific code changes.
  # Default: true
  include_code_suggestions: true

  # focus_areas: (list of strings) Directs the review to prioritize specific aspects of the code.
  # I will pay closer attention to these areas. If omitted, I will consider all areas.
  # Valid values include:
  # - "correctness": Focus on logical errors, edge cases, data validation, API usage.
  # - "efficiency": Focus on performance bottlenecks, resource usage, algorithmic complexity.
  # - "maintainability": Focus on readability, modularity, adherence to best practices, naming.
  # - "security": Focus on potential vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
  # - "testing": Focus on test coverage, quality, and edge case handling.
  # - "performance": (Similar to efficiency, but can also include broader system performance).
  # - "scalability": Focus on how the code will handle growth in users or data.
  # - "modularity": Focus on code organization and reusability.
  # - "error_logging": Focus on effective error logging and monitoring mechanisms.
  # Default: ["correctness", "efficiency", "maintainability", "security"]
  focus_areas:
    - "correctness"
    - "security"

  # style_guide_path: (string) Path to a custom style guide file (e.g., `.gemini/my_style_guide.md`).
  # If provided, I will use this document as a reference for stylistic and best practice
  # recommendations specific to your project. The file should be in Markdown format.
  # Default: Uses commonly accepted language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
  # style_guide_path: ".gemini/my_custom_style_guide.md"

# You can add other top-level configurations here in the future as new features are introduced.
