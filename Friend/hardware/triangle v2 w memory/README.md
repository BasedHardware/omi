   ![PicoBlade cut](pics/2_picoblade_cut.jpg)

### Step 2: Solder XIAO nRF52840 Sense to Adafruit 5769 board

1. Place the two boards side-by-side on a clean, rigid surface. Use a napkin underneath to keep your work area clean.

2. Identify the top 6 pins that need to be soldered between the boards.

   ![Boards side-by-side](pics/3_boards_side-by-side.jpg)

3. Apply a small amount of soldering flux to the pads you'll be soldering.

   ![Boards flux applied](pics/4_boards_flux_applied.jpg)

4. Set your soldering iron to the correct temperature (250¬∞C is enough for lead-containing solder).

5. Apply solder to a first pad, spending about 3-4 seconds per contact. Be careful not to overheat the boards.

   ![First pad soldered](pics/5_first_pad_soldered.jpg)

üí° Tip: Allow the solder to solidify for 2-3 seconds before moving the boards.

6. Check the flatness of the board connection. Resolder it if not flat. Otherwise it won't fit inside the case.

   ![Board flatness](pics/6_board_flatness.jpg)
 
7. Apply solder to pads 2-6, spending about 3-4 seconds per contact. Be careful not to overheat the boards.

   ![All pads soldered 1](pics/7_all_pads_soldered_1.jpg)
   ![All pads soldered 2](pics/8_all_pads_soldered_2.jpg)

8. Check that the solder is visible from the other side of the boards to ensure a solid connection.

   ![All pads other side](pics/9_all_pads_other_side.jpg)

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Be careful not to touch any components other than the pads you're soldering to avoid damaging the boards.

üí° Tip: Use flux sparingly to avoid getting it near the microphone hole or inside the SD card slot.

### Step 3: Attach the button

1. Bend the button contacts as shown in the images below.

   ![Bent button contacts 1](pics/10_bent_button_contacts_1.jpg)
   ![Bent button contacts 2](pics/11_bent_button_contacts_2.jpg)

2. Apply a small amount of cyanoacrylate glue or UV resin to the bottom of the button.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Be careful not to use too much glue, as excess could interfere with the button's functionality.

3. Carefully position the button on the board as shown in the image.

   ![Button placed 1](pics/12_button_placed_1.jpg)
   ![Button placed 2](pics/13_button_placed_2.jpg)
   ![Button placed 3](pics/14_button_placed_3.jpg)

4. If using cyanoacrylate glue, apply firm pressure to the button until the glue sets.

5. If using UV resin, cure it with a UV light for the recommended time.

6. Once the glue has set, solder the button contacts to the underlying pads.

   ![Soldered button](pics/15_soldered_button.jpg)

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Be careful not to short-circuit button contacts to a metal shell of the XIAO board.


### Step 4: Solder board edges with wire

1. Cut six pieces of solid-core wire, each at least 55 mm long.

2. Strip an equal amount of insulation from both ends of each wire, ensuring the unstripped length is exactly 34 mm.

   ![Cut wires](pics/16_cut_wires.jpg)

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Ensure the unstripped wire length is exactly 34 mm to fit properly in the case. Shortening or lengthening it by even 1 mm will prevent proper fitting.

3. Flip the boards. Insert the wires into the holes and bend the ends as shown.

   ![Wire placement front](pics/17_wire_placement_front.jpg)
   ![Wire placement back](pics/18_wire_placement_back.jpg)

4. Apply a small amount of flux to each hole you'll be soldering.

5. Flip the boards one more time -- it's easier to solder them from the front side. Solder each wire end, starting from the top. Hold the iron on each joint for 2-3 seconds.

   ![Wires soldered front](pics/19_wires_soldered_front.jpg)

6. Trim any excess wire flush with the board surface.

   ![Trimmed wires](pics/20_trimmed_wires.jpg)


### Step 5: Solder the speaker

1. Apply a small amount of flux to the speaker connector pins on the board.

2. Solder each speaker wire to its corresponding pin on the board.

   ![Soldered speaker 1](pics/21_soldered_speaker_1.jpg)
   ![Soldered speaker 2](pics/22_soldered_speaker_2.jpg)


### Step 6: Solder the battery

1. Cut the black battery wire to a length of 33 mm, then strip 1 mm from the end.

2. Cut the red battery wire to a length of 37 mm, then strip 1 mm from the end.

   ![Cut battery wires](pics/23_cut_battery_wires.jpg)

2. Position the battery as shown in the image, with the wires oriented correctly.

3. Identify the positive (+) and negative (-) battery pads on the board.

4. Apply a small amount of flux to each battery pad.

5. Solder the red wire to the positive pad and the black wire to the negative pad.

   ![Soldered battery](pics/24_soldered_battery.jpg)

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Incorrect battery polarity can instantly damage the microcontroller. Triple-check your connections before powering on.


### Step 7: Clean the board

Gently clean all soldered areas to remove flux residue. Pay extra attention to the area around the microphone hole. Use a dry cotton swab to absorb any excess alcohol.

Allow the board to air dry completely before proceeding.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Be extremely gentle when cleaning near the microphone hole to avoid clogging it with debris or cotton fibers.


### Step 8: Assembly preparation

1. Using double-sided tape, attach the battery as shown in the photo. Center it against the board to ensure proper fit.

    ![Battery taped 1](pics/25_battery_taped_1.jpg)
    ![Battery taped 2](pics/26_battery_taped_2.jpg)
    ![Battery taped 3](pics/27_battery_taped_3.jpg)

2. Ensure the distance between the battery and the board does not exceed 2 mm. If it does, check if the battery wires are overlapping with the board wires. Distance larger than 2 mm will result in improper fit of the board assembly.

    ![Assembly distance](pics/28_assembly_distance.jpg)

3. Insert the micro SD card into the slot.

    ![SD card inserted](pics/29_sd_card_inserted.jpg)

4. Apply the double-sided tape to the bottom side of the battery.

    ![Battery taped bottom](pics/30_battery_taped_bottom.jpg)

4. Place the board assembly inside the case, starting from the side shown in the photo.

    ![Case assembly](pics/31_case_assembly.jpg)


### Step 9: Attach the speaker to the enclosure

üìù Note: There are two speaker-related chambers in this case, which need to be isolated from each other. This is done to eliminate the interference of sound waves from the two sides of the speaker, which lowers the volume and can cause distortions. The adhesive sealing rim at the front of the speaker serves as this isolation. Additionally, isolating the entire speaker unit from the other components in the case helps reduce microphone noise pollution.

1. Remove the protective layer from the adhesive rim of the speaker.

    ![Speaker protective layer removed](pics/32_speaker_protective_layer_removed.jpg)

2. Position the speaker inside the enclosure as shown in the image. Press it firmly for the adhesive to set. You may additionaly secure with couple of drops of cyanoacrylate glue.

   ![Speaker placement](pics/33_speaker_placement.jpg)

3. Tuck the speaker wires to the board.

4. Apply cyanoacrylate glue to the edges of the speaker cover seating as shown.

   ![Glue application](pics/34_glue_application.jpg)

5. Press the speaker cover firmly into place.

6. Ensure the wire inlet to the speaker compartment is completely sealed.

   ![Sealed wire inlet](pics/35_sealed_wire_inlet.jpg)


### Step 10: Microphone noise isolation (Optional)

üìù Note: This step can help improve audio recording quality by reducing ambient noise picked up by the microphone.

1. Cut a small piece of foam seal gasket to fit over the microphone area. Punch it with a hole punch.

    ![Cut foam seal gasket](pics/36_cut_foam_seal_gasket.jpg)

2. Carefully glue the foam over the microphone area on the board.

   ![Microphone isolation](pics/37_microphone_isolation.jpg)

### Step 11: Assemble the device

1. Ensure all wires are neatly tucked in and not pinched. Ensure the board is sitting tightly inside the case, with nothing is sticking out of it.

2. If using the high-tolerance top cover:
   a. Align the cover with the bottom part.
   b. Gently snap the cover into place, ensuring all edges are secure.

3. If using the low-tolerance top cover:
   a. Apply a thin line of glue around the edge of the bottom part.
   b. Carefully place the top cover onto the bottom part.
   c. Hold in place until the glue sets.

4. Once assembled, gently shake the device to ensure no parts are loose inside.
