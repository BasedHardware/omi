# Node Feature Discovery

Node Feature Discovery (NFD) is a Kubernetes add-on for detecting hardware
features and system configuration. Detected features are advertised as node
labels. NFD provides flexible configuration and extension points for a wide
range of vendor and application specific node labeling needs.

See
[NFD documentation](https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/node-feature-discovery/v0.16/deployment/helm.html)
for deployment instructions.
