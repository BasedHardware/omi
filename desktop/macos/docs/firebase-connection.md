# Firebase connection (desktop debugging)

Use the `/firebase` command if your agent provides it.

Quick connect (from `desktop/macos/`):

```bash
cd ../backend && source venv/bin/activate && python3 -c "
import firebase_admin
from firebase_admin import credentials, firestore, auth
cred = credentials.Certificate('google-credentials.json')
try: firebase_admin.initialize_app(cred)
except ValueError: pass
db = firestore.client()
print('Connected to Firebase: based-hardware')
"
```
