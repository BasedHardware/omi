// Orb waveform — the scrolling amplitude-history visualizer that REPLACES the
// merged speech blob (design pivot, Chris 2026-07-11; the live scrolling look was
// approved by the user 2026-07-11). Audio-active states (recording the user's
// voice; the spoken TTS reply) render a classic voice-memo row: evenly spaced
// vertical rounded-capsule bars whose heights track the live level. A SILENT
// sample renders as a small round DOT (a narrow circle, well below the bar
// height), so the resting waveform is a tidy row of dots — what the 8 ring dots
// fan out into on entry. New samples enter at the RIGHT and the history slides
// left.
//
// Everything here is a PURE function: the sensitivity curve, the ring buffer
// stepping, the history → slot mapping, and the slot → bar geometry. The app's
// OrbAnimator owns the stateful buffer and feeds real time/audio; the
// deterministic harness scripts a levels array straight into computeOrbFrame.
// Bars are returned in the shader's normalized short-axis units (y half-extent =
// 1, x half-extent = aspect), so the fragment shader rasterizes them directly.
