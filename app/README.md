### Quick Setup

1. Navigate to the app directory:
   ```bash
   cd app
   ```

2. Run setup script:
   ```bash
   # For iOS
   bash setup.sh ios

   # For Android
   bash setup.sh android
   ```

3. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run --flavor dev
   ```

## Firebase Configuration

The app supports two methods for Firebase configuration:

### 1. Environment Variables (Recommended)

Firebase credentials can be loaded from environment variables, which is the recommended approach for security and flexibility:

1. Update the `.dev.env` file with your Firebase project details:
   ```
   # Firebase Configuration
   FIREBASE_ANDROID_API_KEY=your_android_api_key
   FIREBASE_ANDROID_APP_ID=your_android_app_id
   FIREBASE_IOS_API_KEY=your_ios_api_key
   FIREBASE_IOS_APP_ID=your_ios_app_id
   FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
   FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
   FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
   FIREBASE_ANDROID_CLIENT_ID=your_android_client_id
   FIREBASE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=your_ios_client_id
   FIREBASE_IOS_BUNDLE_ID=your_ios_bundle_id
   ```

2. Run the build_runner to generate the necessary files:
   ```bash
   dart run build_runner build
   ```

3. The app will automatically use these environment variables for Firebase initialization.

### 2. Hardcoded Configuration (Fallback)

The app maintains hardcoded Firebase configurations as a fallback mechanism. If environment variables are not set or are incomplete, the app will automatically fall back to using the hardcoded configuration files:

- `lib/firebase_options_dev.dart` for development
- `lib/firebase_options_prod.dart` for production
