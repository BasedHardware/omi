### iOS Setup Issues with Ruby Gems

If you encounter Ruby gem dependency errors during iOS setup (particularly with fastlane), follow these steps:

1. Install Bundler (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   sudo gem install bundler
   ```

2. Create a Gemfile in the app directory with required gems:
   ```bash
   cat > Gemfile << EOL
   source "https://rubygems.org"

   gem "fastlane"
   gem "cocoapods"
   gem "nkf"
   EOL
   ```

3. Install gems using Bundler:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

4. Run the iOS setup using Bundler:
   ```bash
   bundle exec bash setup.sh ios
   ```

This approach ensures all required Ruby dependencies are properly installed and managed.
