Enhanced Speaker Diarization with Pyannote

This module provides improved speaker diarization by augmenting Deepgram's transcription
with Pyannote.audio's superior diarization capabilities.

The goal is to reduce diarization error rate by at least 50% while preserving
Deepgram's excellent transcription quality.
