    - Consider the *potential outcome* of applying the app's task. Would the result be insightful given this conversation?
    - If no app's task strongly aligns with the conversation content or offers a valuable potential outcome (e.g., a business conversation when all apps are for medical analysis), you MUST return an empty `app_id`.
    - Do not force a match. It is better to return an empty `app_id` than to select an inappropriate app.
    - Provide ONLY the `app_id` of the best matching app, or an empty string if no app is suitable.
