    The content language is {language_code}. Use the same language {language_code} for your response.{existing_items_context}

    CRITICAL DEDUPLICATION RULES (Check BEFORE extracting):
    • DO NOT extract action items that are >95% similar to existing ones listed above
    • Check both the description AND the due date/timeframe
    • Consider semantic similarity, not just exact word matches
    • Examples of what counts as DUPLICATES (DO NOT extract):
      - "Call John" vs "Phone John" → DUPLICATE
      - "Finish report by Friday" (existing) vs "Complete report by end of week" → DUPLICATE
      - "Buy milk" (existing) vs "Get milk from store" → DUPLICATE
      - "Email Sarah about meeting" (existing) vs "Send email to Sarah regarding the meeting" → DUPLICATE
    • Examples of what is NOT duplicate (OK to extract):
      - "Buy groceries" (existing) vs "Buy milk" → NOT duplicate (different scope)
      - "Call dentist" (existing) vs "Call plumber" → NOT duplicate (different person/service)
      - "Submit report by March 1st" (existing) vs "Submit report by March 15th" → NOT duplicate (different deadlines)
    • If you're unsure whether something is a duplicate, err on the side of treating it as a duplicate (DON'T extract)

    WORKFLOW:
    1. FIRST: Read the ENTIRE conversation carefully to understand the full context
    2. SECOND: Identify all topics, people, places, or things being discussed
    3. THIRD: Filter aggressively - is the user ALREADY doing this? If yes, SKIP IT
    4. FOURTH: Ask - "Is this truly important enough to remind a busy person?" If no, SKIP IT
    5. FIFTH: Extract ONLY action items that passed steps 3 & 4, using specific names/details
    6. SIXTH: Extract timing information separately and put it in the due_at field
    7. SEVENTH: Clean the description - remove ALL time references and vague words
    8. EIGHTH: Final check - description should be timeless and specific (e.g., "Buy groceries" NOT "buy them by tomorrow")

    CRITICAL CONTEXT:
    • These action items are primarily for the PRIMARY USER who is having/recording this conversation
    • The user is the person wearing the device or initiating the conversation
    • Focus on tasks the primary user needs to track and act upon
    • Include tasks for OTHER people ONLY if:
      - The primary user is dependent on that task being completed
      - It's super crucial for the primary user to track it
      - The primary user needs to follow up on it

    QUALITY OVER QUANTITY:
    • Better to have 0 action items than to flood the user with unnecessary ones
    • Only extract action items that are truly important and need tracking
    • When in doubt, DON'T extract - be conservative and selective
    • Think: "Would a busy person want to be reminded of this?"

    STRICT FILTERING RULES - Include ONLY tasks that meet ALL these criteria:

    1. **Clear Ownership & Relevance to Primary User**:
       - Identify which speaker is the primary user based on conversational context
       - Look for cues: who is asking questions, who is receiving advice/tasks, who initiates topics
       - For tasks assigned to the primary user: phrase them directly (start with verb)
       - For tasks assigned to others: include them ONLY if primary user is dependent on them or needs to track them
       - If a person's name is mentioned and there's high confidence (>90%) they are a speaker, use that name
       - NEVER use "Speaker 0", "Speaker 1", etc. in the final action item description
       - If unsure about names, use natural phrasing like "Follow up on...", "Ensure...", etc.

    2. **Concrete Action**: The task describes a specific, actionable next step (not vague intentions)

    3. **Timing Signal**: The task includes a timing cue:
       - Explicit dates or times
       - Relative timing ("tomorrow", "next week", "by Friday", "this month")
       - Urgency markers ("urgent", "ASAP", "high priority")

    4. **Real Importance**: The task has genuine consequences if missed:
       - Financial impact (bills, payments, purchases, invoices)
       - Health/safety concerns (appointments, medications, safety checks)
       - Hard deadlines (submissions, filings, registrations)
       - Explicit stress if missed (stated by speakers)
       - Critical dependencies (primary user blocked without it)
       - Commitments to other people (meetings, deliverables, promises)

    5. **NOT Already Being Done**: The user is NOT currently actively working on it:
       - If user says "I am working on X" or "I am doing X right now" → DON'T extract
       - If user says "I am in the middle of X" → DON'T extract
       - If user says "currently doing X" → DON'T extract
       - Only extract if it's something they NEED TO DO in the future, not something they're ALREADY doing

       Examples of what NOT to extract:
       - ❌ "I am working on the budget report. Need to finish it by Friday" → User is ALREADY working on it, they know the deadline
       - ❌ "Currently debugging the login issue" → User is actively doing it
       - ❌ "I'm preparing for the presentation tomorrow" → User is already aware and doing it
       - ✅ "Need to call the plumber tomorrow about the leak" → User is NOT doing it yet, needs reminder
       - ✅ "Have to submit tax documents by March 31st" → Clear future deadline that needs tracking
       - ✅ "Doctor said to schedule follow-up in 2 weeks" → Easy to forget, needs reminder

    EXCLUDE these types of items (be aggressive about exclusion):
    • Things user is ALREADY doing or actively working on
    • Casual mentions or updates ("I'm working on X", "currently doing Y")
    • Vague suggestions without commitment ("we should grab coffee sometime", "let's meet up soon")
    • Casual mentions without commitment ("maybe I'll check that out")
    • General goals without specific next steps ("I need to exercise more")
    • Past actions being discussed
    • Hypothetical scenarios ("if we do X, then Y")
    • Trivial tasks with no real consequences
    • Tasks assigned to others that don't impact the primary user
    • Routine daily activities the user already knows about
    • Things that are obvious or don't need a reminder
    • Updates or status reports about ongoing work

    FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
    • Keep each action item SHORT and concise (maximum 15 words, strict limit)
    • Use clear, direct language
    • Start with a verb when possible (e.g., "Call", "Send", "Review", "Pay", "Open", "Submit", "Finish", "Complete")
    • Include only essential details

    • CRITICAL - Resolve ALL vague references:
      - Read the ENTIRE conversation to understand what is being discussed
      - If you see vague references like:
        * "the feature" → identify WHAT feature from conversation
        * "this project" → identify WHICH project from conversation
        * "that task" → identify WHAT task from conversation
        * "it" → identify what "it" refers to from conversation
      - Look for keywords, topics, or subjects mentioned earlier in the conversation
      - Replace ALL vague words with specific names from the conversation context
      - Examples:
        * User says: "planning Sarah's birthday party" then later "buy decorations for it"
          → Extract: "Buy decorations for Sarah's birthday party"
        * User says: "car making weird noise" then later "take it to mechanic"
          → Extract: "Take car to mechanic"
        * User says: "quarterly sales report" then later "send it to the team"
          → Extract: "Send quarterly sales report to team"

    • CRITICAL - Remove time references from description (they go in due_at field):
      - NEVER include timing words in the action item description itself
      - Remove: "by tomorrow", "by evening", "today", "next week", "by Friday", etc.
      - The timing information is captured in the due_at field separately
      - Focus ONLY on the action and what needs to be done
      - Examples:
        * "buy groceries by tomorrow" → "Buy groceries"
        * "call dentist by next Monday" → "Call dentist"
        * "pay electricity bill by Friday" → "Pay electricity bill"
        * "submit insurance claim today" → "Submit insurance claim"
        * "book flight tickets by evening" → "Book flight tickets"

    • Remove filler words and unnecessary context
    • Merge duplicates
    • Order by: due date → urgency → alphabetical

    DUE DATE EXTRACTION (CRITICAL):
    IMPORTANT: All due dates must be in the FUTURE and in UTC format with 'Z' suffix.
    IMPORTANT: When parsing dates, FIRST determine the DATE (today/tomorrow/specific date), THEN apply the TIME.

    Step-by-step date parsing process:
    1. IDENTIFY THE DATE:
       - "today" → current date from {started_at}
       - "tomorrow" → next day from {started_at}
       - "Monday", "Tuesday", etc. → next occurrence of that weekday
       - "next week" → same day next week
       - Specific date (e.g., "March 15") → that date

    2. IDENTIFY THE TIME (if mentioned):
       - "before 10am", "by 10am", "at 10am" → 10:00 AM
       - "before 3pm", "by 3pm", "at 3pm" → 3:00 PM
       - "in the morning" → 9:00 AM
       - "in the afternoon" → 2:00 PM
       - "in the evening", "by evening" → 6:00 PM
       - "at noon" → 12:00 PM
       - "by midnight", "by end of day" → 11:59 PM
       - No time mentioned → 11:59 PM (end of day)

    3. COMBINE DATE + TIME in user's timezone ({tz}), then convert to UTC with 'Z' suffix

    Examples of CORRECT date parsing:
    If {started_at} is "2025-10-03T13:25:00Z" (Oct 3, 6:55 PM IST) and {tz} is "Asia/Kolkata":
    - "tomorrow before 10am" → DATE: Oct 4, TIME: 10:00 AM → "2025-10-04 10:00 IST" → Convert to UTC → "2025-10-04T04:30:00Z"
    - "today by evening" → DATE: Oct 3, TIME: 6:00 PM → "2025-10-03 18:00 IST" → Convert to UTC → "2025-10-03T12:30:00Z"
    - "tomorrow" → DATE: Oct 4, TIME: 11:59 PM (default) → "2025-10-04 23:59 IST" → Convert to UTC → "2025-10-04T18:29:00Z"
    - "by Monday at 2pm" → DATE: next Monday (Oct 6), TIME: 2:00 PM → "2025-10-06 14:00 IST" → Convert to UTC → "2025-10-06T08:30:00Z"
    - "urgent" or "ASAP" → 2 hours from {started_at} → "2025-10-03T15:25:00Z"

    CRITICAL FORMAT: All due_at timestamps MUST be in UTC with 'Z' suffix (e.g., "2025-10-04T04:30:00Z")
    DO NOT include timezone offsets like "+05:30". Always convert to UTC and use 'Z' suffix.
