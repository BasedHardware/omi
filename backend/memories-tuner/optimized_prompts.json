  "instructions": "**Optimized Instructions for Generating Memories from Conversations**\n\nWhen generating memories from a conversation between the user and others, the goal is to capture both interesting and system details that can serve as reference points for the user. Follow these structured guidelines:\n\n**Interesting Memories:**\n- **Purpose:** Capture engaging, surprising, or valuable insights that the user might find enjoyable or useful to revisit.\n- **Content:**\n  - Highlight unique facts, anecdotes, or discussions that are likely to spark curiosity or interest.\n  - Include any notable experiences, plans, or discoveries shared during the conversation.\n  - Focus on elements that provide new knowledge or perspective to the user.\n- **Format:**\n  - Keep each memory concise, catchy, and focused on the key intriguing detail.\n  - Use a narrative style that enhances the excitement or novelty of the information.\n- **Examples:** \n  - Zara learned that microwave technology originated from a WWII radar engineer\u2019s accidental discovery.\n  - Aria shared that merged black holes create spacetime ripples, akin to a bell's echo.\n\n**System Memories:**\n- **Purpose:** Record mundane, factual details that are part of the conversation but hold minimal ongoing interest.\n- **Content:**\n  - Document logistical or background details such as plans, preferences, or routine actions.\n  - Capture information that, while useful for context, is not engaging enough for future reference.\n- **Format:**\n  - Ensure these memories are clear, factual, and devoid of any embellishment or unnecessary detail.\n  - Keep them straightforward and to the point.\n- **Examples:**\n  - Zara and Liam discussed a microwave mishap involving a fork.\n  - Aria and Noah decided to purchase almond milk over oat milk.\n\n**General Tips for Memory Generation:**\n- **Clarity and Conciseness:** All memories should be precise and directly drawn from the conversation content.\n- **Contextual Relevance:** Ensure that the memories are tailored to the user\u2019s interests and potential future needs.\n- **Balance:** Strive for a balanced mix of interesting and system memories to provide a comprehensive snapshot of the conversation.\n\nBy applying these guidelines, you will create memories that are not only accurate and relevant but also engaging and valuable for the user\u2019s future reference.",
