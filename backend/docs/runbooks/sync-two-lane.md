# Two-lane offline sync

`backend-sync` is the upload admission service. It authoritatively classifies each homogeneous upload as:

- `fresh`: oldest capture time is at most `SYNC_FRESH_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` (default six hours). Jobs use `SYNC_TASKS_QUEUE` and may use the existing bounded inline fallback.
- `backfill`: historical, missing, invalid, or future-skewed capture time. Jobs use `SYNC_BACKFILL_TASKS_QUEUE` and the `backend-sync-backfill` service. Backfill never falls back inline.

Capture timestamps are client assertions, so a well-formed device header alone never grants the fresh lane. For a server-created conversation on the same authenticated install, mobile first hashes the exact raw files and requests a short-lived server-signed manifest binding UID, device, conversation, filename timestamps, and SHA-256 identities. Admission verifies the signature and conversation window; after upload it verifies the bytes against the signed digests before dispatch. Uploads without that proof—including Transcribe Later and offline files—are conservative backfill. Missing, invalid, future, expired, or byte-mismatched claims cannot enter fresh.

A signed fresh manifest covers at most 20 files. Mobile detects a conversation with more than 20 pending fresh WALs before requesting a manifest and routes the whole conversation through backfill in three-file batches. It never claims one immutable fresh content set and strands the remainder behind a conflicting manifest.

Historical recovery defaults are a 30-day lookback, one in-flight job per UID, four processed speech hours per UID per UTC day, 555 processed speech hours globally per UTC day, and four globally concurrent Cloud Tasks. Change the first three limits with `SYNC_BACKFILL_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`, `SYNC_BACKFILL_USER_DAILY_HOURS`, and `SYNC_BACKFILL_GLOBAL_DAILY_HOURS`; queue concurrency is controlled by the shared `.github/actions/sync-backfill-lifecycle` composite used by both manual and auto-dev deploys.

Production deploys require `SYNC_BACKFILL_ALERT_NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS` as a comma-separated list of Cloud Monitoring notification-channel resource names. The workflow provisions log-based metrics and routed alert policies at 70% and 90%, then verifies each policy has a notification channel before traffic shifts.

Backfill speech is written under the `sync_backfill` accounting source. Live hard restrictions read only `realtime` and `sync_fresh`. A queue or Redis admission failure returns `backfill_capacity`; a per-user slot or daily-limit rejection returns `backfill_paced`, both with `Retry-After`. Mobile retains the WAL and pauses only the historical lane.

The content ledger is stored at `users/{uid}/sync_content_ledger/{content_id}`. Its `expires_at` field is retained for 45 days; both the manual and auto-dev deploy paths provision and verify the Firestore TTL policy via `sync-backfill-lifecycle`. The stable content ID is an HMAC over UID plus each stable capture filename and raw-audio digest, preventing identical silence at different capture times from collapsing; `SYNC_CONTENT_ID_SECRET` may be set independently, otherwise `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` is used. Metering uses content-keyed atomic Redis/Firestore increments so a worker crash cannot double-count a retry. A job-level partial result is checkpointed before each processed-segment marker and hydrated on retry, so an accounting retry still returns the conversations created by the first attempt.

`backend-sync-backfill` clones the complete live `backend-sync` runtime env and secret-reference contract, then applies the checked-in backfill overlays. This keeps Redis, STT, storage, and service-auth bindings aligned without exposing secret values. BYOK historical uploads fail closed and remain on-device because request-scoped keys cannot be serialized into the isolated task; fresh BYOK retains the legacy inline path.

## Rollback

Pause `sync-backfill` in Cloud Tasks or set the global daily allowance to a value below current usage. Do not route backfill into `sync-jobs`, disable lane-specific accounting, or enable inline fallback. Fresh uploads remain operational while the historical queue is paused.

## Release acceptance

Upload a synthetic eight-day backlog and then create a current recording. Verify the current recording reaches a terminal job first, historical jobs never exceed four concurrent dispatches, live fair-use totals exclude `sync_backfill`, and replaying the same raw upload returns the durable completed result without new metering.
