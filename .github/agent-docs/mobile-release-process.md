# Mobile release process

This is the repository-side contract for shipping the Flutter mobile app. It
describes admission and evidence; it does not grant store credentials or
replace the Codemagic/App Store Connect/Google Play owner runbooks.

## Release identity

Production mobile tags must use:

```text
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>+<positive-build>-ios-cm
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>+<positive-build>-android-cm
v<major>.<minor>.<patch>+<positive-build>-mobile-cm
```

`-ios-cm` may enter the iOS workflow, `-android-cm` may enter Android, and the
historical `-mobile-cm` form remains valid for either platform. The workflow
validates the tag, checked-out commit, and tag-resolved commit before invoking
Flutter. A malformed tag, platform mismatch, or source mismatch stops the
build.

## Admission evidence

The release source must have both of these successful checks on the exact SHA:

1. the first-attempt `Release Eligibility` push run on `main`;
2. the `Mobile Release Eligibility` aggregate from `Mobile App Checks`.

The aggregate deliberately treats conditionally inapplicable mobile jobs as
`skipped`, while failures, cancellations, pending results, wrong repositories,
wrong workflows, reruns, and wrong SHAs fail admission. The offline contract
and fixture tests live in `.github/scripts/verify_mobile_release_admission.py`.

## Store and distribution behavior

Automatic internal builds fail closed when an App Store Connect or Google Play
version lookup fails or returns malformed data. A successful empty response is
still allowed to seed from `pubspec.yaml`; a command failure is never turned
into build zero.

The internal dispatcher advances an iOS or Android baseline only after explicit
platform-matched distribution evidence. Upload/build completion alone is not a
distribution receipt. The current destination policy remains TestFlight
internal for iOS and Play internal with alpha promotion for Android.

## Operator prerequisites

- GitHub branch protection must require the intended release-eligibility and
  mobile aggregate checks before tag admission is enabled.
- Tagged Codemagic workflows need a read-only `GITHUB_TOKEN` (or equivalent
  Codemagic environment variable) for `collect_mobile_release_admission.py`.
  The collector authenticates the GitHub run/check evidence before the local
  verifier accepts it; a missing token fails the tag build closed.
- Codemagic internal dispatch passes an evaluated source-SHA pin as an
  environment variable; the internal workflow compares it with its checked-out
  `HEAD` before doing build work. A branch move therefore fails closed.
- The dispatcher fetches Codemagic build details and requires a normalized,
  platform-matched post-publish receipt before a platform baseline advances.
  iOS requires every App Store Connect task to succeed; Android requires the
  settled Codemagic publishing action. Missing, failed, or unknown evidence
  keeps that platform pending.
- App Store Connect beta-group membership and automatic distribution are
  operator-owned. An uploaded/processed IPA is not proof that the intended
  group can receive it; verify the configured group and its capabilities in
  App Store Connect when investigating a failed post-publish task.

No workflow in this document silently promotes a build to public production.
