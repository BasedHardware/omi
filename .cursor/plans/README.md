# Plans Directory

This directory contains plans generated by Cursor's Plan Mode. Plans are automatically saved here when you click "Save to workspace" in Plan Mode.

## Purpose

- **Future Reference**: Plans document architectural decisions and implementation strategies
- **Team Sharing**: Plans can be shared with team members to understand complex changes
- **Documentation**: Plans serve as living documentation of how features were implemented

## Usage

Plans are created automatically when using Plan Mode. You can:

1. Review saved plans to understand past implementations
2. Reference plans when working on related features
3. Share plans with team members for context

## File Naming

Plans are typically named with descriptive identifiers and timestamps to help organize and find them later.
