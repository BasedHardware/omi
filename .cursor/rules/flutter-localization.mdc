# Flutter Localization

All user-facing strings must use localization. Use `context.l10n.keyName` instead of hardcoded strings.

## Rules

1. Never use hardcoded strings for user-facing text
2. Add new keys to ARB files using `jq` (never read full ARB files - they're large)
3. After modifying ARB files in `app/lib/l10n/`, regenerate localizations:
   ```bash
   cd app && flutter gen-l10n
   ```

## Examples

```dart
// Bad
Text('Hello World')

// Good
Text(context.l10n.helloWorld)
```
