# Subagents vs Skills

Understanding when to use subagents versus skills helps optimize performance, cost, and context usage.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Use Subagents When... | Use Skills When... |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| Need context isolation for long research | Task is single-purpose (generate changelog, format) |
| Running multiple workstreams in parallel | Want a quick, repeatable action |
| Task requires specialized expertise across many steps | Task completes in one shot |
| Want independent verification of work | Don't need a separate context window |

## Subagents

### What They Are

Subagents are specialized AI assistants that operate in their own context window. They:
- Have their own context (isolated from main conversation)
- Work autonomously and return results
- Can run in parallel
- Have specialized prompts and tool access

### When to Use

**Context isolation needed:**
- Long research tasks that would bloat main context
- Tasks generating large intermediate output
- Exploration that produces verbose results

**Parallel execution:**
- Multiple independent workstreams
- Different parts of codebase simultaneously
- Independent verification

**Specialized expertise:**
- Complex tasks requiring deep domain knowledge
- Multi-step workflows
- Tasks that benefit from focused context

**Examples:**
- Exploring large codebase to understand architecture
- Running series of shell commands with verbose output
- Browser interactions with noisy DOM snapshots
- Long-running research tasks

### Trade-offs

**Benefits:**
- Context isolation (main conversation stays clean)
- Parallel execution (multiple tasks simultaneously)
- Specialized focus (tuned prompts and tools)

**Costs:**
- Startup overhead (each subagent gathers context)
- Higher token usage (multiple contexts)
- May be slower for simple tasks

## Skills

### What They Are

Skills are reusable capabilities that:
- Package domain-specific knowledge
- Activate automatically based on context
- Complete tasks in one shot
- Don't use separate context windows

### When to Use

**Single-purpose tasks:**
- Generate changelog
- Format code
- Update documentation
- Run specific workflow

**Quick, repeatable actions:**
- Tasks that complete immediately
- No need for separate context
- Simple, focused operations

**Examples:**
- `/format` - Format code
- `/auto-changelog` - Generate changelog
- `/update-api-docs` - Update documentation

### Trade-offs

**Benefits:**
- Fast (no context isolation overhead)
- Efficient (single context window)
- Automatic (activate based on context)

**Limitations:**
- Share context with main conversation
- Not suitable for long-running tasks
- Can't run in parallel (same context)

## Decision Criteria

### Use Subagents If:

1. **Task generates verbose output**: Logs, search results, browser snapshots
2. **Long-running research**: Deep codebase exploration
3. **Parallel work needed**: Multiple independent tasks
4. **Context would bloat main conversation**: Large intermediate results
5. **Specialized model needed**: Faster model for exploration

### Use Skills If:

1. **Single-purpose task**: One clear action
2. **Quick completion**: Finishes in one shot
3. **No context isolation needed**: Results are concise
4. **Automatic activation**: Should trigger based on context
5. **Reusable pattern**: Common workflow

## Built-in Subagents

Cursor includes three built-in subagents:

1. **Explore**: Searches and analyzes codebases (uses faster model, parallel searches)
2. **Bash**: Runs shell commands (isolates verbose output)
3. **Browser**: Controls browser (filters noisy DOM/screenshots)

These activate automatically when appropriate.

## Performance and Cost

### Subagents

**Token usage:**
- Each subagent has independent context
- Running 5 subagents ≈ 5x token usage
- Evaluate overhead vs benefit

**Speed:**
- Context isolation benefit, not speed
- May be slower for simple tasks
- Faster for complex, parallel work

### Skills

**Token usage:**
- Share main conversation context
- More efficient for simple tasks
- No isolation overhead

**Speed:**
- Faster for quick tasks
- No startup overhead
- Immediate activation

## Omi-Specific Examples

### Use Subagents For:

**Complex refactoring:**
- Multiple files need changes
- Requires understanding entire system
- Parallel work on different components

**Deep debugging:**
- Need to explore codebase extensively
- Generate hypotheses and test
- Long research phase

**Multi-component features:**
- Backend + Flutter + Docs changes
- Each component needs separate context
- Parallel implementation

### Use Skills For:

**Formatting:**
- `/format` - Quick code formatting
- Single action, immediate result

**Documentation:**
- `/auto-docs` - Update docs
- Detects changes, updates docs

**Changelog:**
- `/auto-changelog` - Generate changelog
- Parses commits, generates entry

## Best Practices

### Choosing Subagents

1. **Evaluate complexity**: Is context isolation worth overhead?
2. **Consider parallel work**: Can tasks run simultaneously?
3. **Check output verbosity**: Will results bloat main context?
4. **Assess specialization**: Does task need specialized prompts?

### Choosing Skills

1. **Check task scope**: Single-purpose or multi-step?
2. **Consider activation**: Should it trigger automatically?
3. **Evaluate reusability**: Common pattern or one-off?
4. **Assess completion time**: Quick or long-running?
