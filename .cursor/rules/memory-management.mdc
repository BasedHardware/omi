# Memory Management

Free large objects immediately after use to prevent memory leaks and improve performance.

## Examples

- Use `del` for byte arrays after processing
- Use `.clear()` for dicts/lists holding large amounts of data
- Close file handles and database connections promptly
- Release resources in finally blocks or context managers

```python
# Good
def process_large_data():
    data = load_large_dataset()  # Large byte array
    result = process(data)
    del data  # Free memory immediately
    return result

# Good
def process_dict():
    cache = {}
    # ... populate cache with large data ...
    result = use_cache(cache)
    cache.clear()  # Free memory
    return result
```
