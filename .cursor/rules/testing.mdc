# Testing

Always run tests before committing changes to verify your changes work correctly.

## Test Commands

- **Backend changes**: Run `backend/test.sh`
- **App changes**: Run `app/test.sh`

## Process

1. After making changes, identify which test suite to run
2. Run the appropriate test script
3. Fix any failures
4. Re-run tests until all pass
5. Only then commit your changes
