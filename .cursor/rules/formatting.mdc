# Formatting Standards

Always format code after making changes. The pre-commit hook handles this automatically, but you can also run manually.

## Formatting Commands

### Dart (app/)
```bash
dart format --line-length 120 <files>
```
**Note**: Files ending in `.gen.dart` or `.g.dart` are auto-generated and should not be formatted manually.

### Python (backend/)
```bash
black --line-length 120 <files>
```
**Note**: String normalization settings come from `backend/pyproject.toml` (skip-string-normalization = true).

### C/C++ (firmware: omi/, omiGlass/)
```bash
clang-format -i <files>
```

## Auto-Formatting

The pre-commit hook automatically formats code on commit. To install:
```bash
ln -s -f ../../scripts/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
