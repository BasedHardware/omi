# Context Optimization Skill

Strategies for effective context management: @ mentions, context window optimization, and semantic search.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Managing context window efficiently
- Providing targeted references
- Optimizing @ mention usage
- Using semantic search effectively
- Understanding context limits

## Capabilities

### @ Mentions

- **@Files & Folders**: Reference files or directories
- **@Code**: Reference specific code sections
- **@Docs**: Reference documentation

### Context Optimization

- Context window management
- Strategic @ mention usage
- Let agent gather context when appropriate
- Reference files instead of copying

### Semantic Search

- Natural language queries
- Incremental understanding
- Code discovery
- Pattern finding

## Best Practices

### @ Mentions

**Use for:**
- Specific examples to follow
- Related code patterns
- Configuration files
- Cross-referencing

**Let agent search for:**
- General questions
- Broad exploration
- Discovery tasks
- Understanding flows

### Context Window

1. Use @ mentions selectively
2. Let agent search automatically
3. Reference files, don't copy
4. Break into chunks for large tasks
5. Use Plan Mode for complex features
