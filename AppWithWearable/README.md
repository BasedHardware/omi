A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

FlutterFlow projects are built to run on the Flutter _stable_ release.

## Integration Tests

To test on a real iOS / Android device, first connect the device and run the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
flutter test integration_test/test.dart
```

To test on a web browser, first launch `chromedriver` as follows:
```bash
chromedriver --port=4444
```

Then from the root of the project, run the following command:
```bash
flutter drive \
  --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
  --target=integration_test/test.dart \
  -d chrome
```
