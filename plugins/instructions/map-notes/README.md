## 📌 Pin Your Thoughts to the World

Map Notes allows you to effortlessly create public location-based notes from your conversations. It's like leaving pins across a global map!
Note: When using Map Notes, only memories that include your geolocation will be captured

## 🌟 Creating a Pin

The triggers to start and end a map note are found in the `Start and End Phrases` section
Anything between those two words in the transcript of a memory will automatically be added to the global map based on your location.
Memories without these phrases are ignored.

## Start and End Phrases

Start: `Start map note`, `Clip this` <br/>
End: `End map note`, `Clip that`
