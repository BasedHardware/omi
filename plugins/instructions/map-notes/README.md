## 📌 Pin Your Thoughts to the World
Map Notes allows you to effortlessly create public location-based notes from your conversations. It's like leaving pins across a global map!

## 🌟 Creating a Pin
The triggers to start and end a map note are `start` and `finish`. 
Anything between those two words in the transcript of a memory will automatically be added to the global map based on your location.
Memories without these phrases are ignored.

## 💡 Use Cases

- **Collaborative Exploration**: Share hidden gems with your community.
- **Travel Journaling**: Capture the essence of places you visit.
- **Location-based Reminders**: "Note to self: Great coffee shop here!"
- **Personal Growth**: Share your thoughts and feelings across different environments.
