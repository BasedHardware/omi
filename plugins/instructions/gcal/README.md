## 🚀 Getting Started

### [Click here to connect your Google Calendar](https://omigcal.soundbrain.cc/intro)

Or follow these steps manually:

### 1. Create a Dedicated Calendar (Recommended)

Before connecting, we recommend creating a separate calendar for OMI events:

1. Go to [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com)
2. On the left side, find "Other calendars" and click the "+" button
3. Select "Create new calendar"
4. Name it something like "OMI Events" or "OMI Meetings"
5. (Optional) Choose a color for easy identification
6. Click "Create calendar"

This helps keep your OMI events organized and separate from your personal or work calendar events.

### 2. Enable and Authorize the Integration

1. Visit Apps 
2. Click on "Connect Google Calendar"
3. Log in to your Google account (if not already logged in)
4. Authorize OMI to access your Google Calendar
   > Note: You may see a security warning during the verification process. This is expected and you can safely proceed.

### 3. Configure the Integration

After authorization, you'll be redirected to the configuration page. Here's what you need to set up:

1. **Select Calendar**:
   - Choose your newly created OMI calendar (if you created one)
   - Or select any other calendar you prefer
2. Click "Save Configuration" to complete the setup.

## 📝 Important Notes

- When you create a memory in OMI that includes an event, it will automatically create a corresponding event in your selected Google Calendar
- Your Google account remains secure and is only accessed as per the permissions you grant
- You can always change your calendar selection later by revisiting the configuration page
- During the Google verification process, you'll see security warnings - this is normal and expected
- The integration only creates calendar events; it doesn't access or modify any other calendar data
