# Google Calendar Integration with Composio

/claim #1980

## Changes Made

This PR implements continuous synchronization for Google Calendar events using Composio, replacing the previous manual import approach. The key improvements include:

1. **Real-time Calendar Synchronization**: Events are automatically imported to OMI as they are created or updated in Google Calendar
2. **Webhook Integration**: Set up proper webhook handling for real-time updates from Google Calendar
3. **Robust Error Handling**: Added fallback mechanisms and improved error handling throughout the integration
4. **User Experience Improvements**: Updated UI to make continuous synchronization the recommended default option

## Technical Implementation

- Used Composio's API for authentication and event synchronization
- Implemented webhook handlers to process real-time calendar event updates
- Added fallback mechanisms when webhook creation methods aren't available
- Updated documentation to explain the new continuous synchronization feature

## Benefits

- **Faster Integration**: Teams with limited resources can now integrate OMI with Google Calendar without manual imports
- **Always Up-to-date**: Calendar events in OMI are always synchronized with Google Calendar
- **Better User Experience**: Users don't need to manually import events after the initial setup

This implementation addresses the need for a more scalable approach to platform integration, as mentioned in the issue discussion.
