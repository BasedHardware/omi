# Advanced Example

This `openglass.py` example, requires you to have [openglass](https://github.com/BasedHardware/Omi/OpenGlass).

OpenGlass can be connected with the current Omi App, and memories + retrieval will work with it.

Photos from OpenGlass will be send to the app every 10 seconds, and you'll get a description of the image content, generated with gpt4-vision.
