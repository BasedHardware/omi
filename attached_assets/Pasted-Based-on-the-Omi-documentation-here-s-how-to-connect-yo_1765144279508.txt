Based on the Omi documentation, here’s how to connect your cloned repo to the iOS app:

## **Quick Setup (Already Done)**

You mentioned you already ran:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BasedHardware/omi.git
cd omi/app
bash setup.sh ios
```

## **Connecting to the App**

### **1. Configure Backend Connection**

The iOS app needs to point to your backend. You have two options:

**Option A: Use Local Backend**

```bash
# In the backend directory
cd omi/backend
# Set up your environment variables
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your API keys (OpenAI, Deepgram, etc.)
# Start the backend
python main.py
```

Then in the app, configure it to point to your local backend (usually `http://localhost:8000` or your local IP).

**Option B: Use Omi’s Cloud Backend** (easier for testing)

- Just use the default backend URL
- You’ll need to create an account in the app

### **2. Run the iOS App**

```bash
cd omi/app
# Open in Xcode
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# Or run directly
flutter run
```

### **3. Connect Physical Device or Simulator**

**For Physical Omi Device:**

- Open the app on your iPhone
- Go to Settings → Device Settings
- Pair with your Omi hardware via Bluetooth

**For Testing Without Hardware:**

- The app has a “Phone Mic” mode
- Settings → Enable “Use Phone Microphone”
- This lets you test ZEKE functionality without the pendant

### **4. Custom ZEKE Integration**

Since you have a `zeke-core` directory, you likely want to integrate your custom logic:

```bash
# Your custom backend might be in zeke-core
cd omi/zeke-core
# Start your custom ZEKE backend
# The app should point to this instead of the default backend
```

**In the app config** (usually `lib/env/env.dart` or similar):

```dart
// Point to your ZEKE backend
static const String apiBaseUrl = 'http://YOUR_LOCAL_IP:8000';
```

### **5. Enable Developer Mode**

In the Omi app:

- Settings → About → Tap version 7 times (enables developer mode)
- This gives you access to additional debugging features

**Need more specific help?** Let me know:

- Are you trying to run your custom ZEKE backend?
- Do you have the physical Omi device or testing with phone mic?
- Are you getting any specific errors?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
