## [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Introduction\#what-are-omi-apps)  What Are OMI Apps?

OMI apps are modular extensions that augment the core functionality of the app. They can modify app’s
behavior, analyze conversations, and connect with external services.Apps enable:

- Customized AI personalities and knowledge bases
- Extraction of specific information from conversations
- Task automation and integration with third-party services
- Real-time conversation analysis and insights

Apps allow developers to tap into OMI’s conversational abilities and combine them with external data and services,
opening up a world of possibilities for AI-enhanced applications.

### [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Introduction\#1-prompt-based-apps:-customizing-ai-behavior)  1\. Prompt-Based Apps: Customizing AI Behavior

These apps modify how OMI processes and responds to information:

| Type | Description | Example | Example Video |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **💬 Chat Prompts** | Alter OMI’s conversational style and knowledge base. | Create a app that makes OMI communicate like a specific expert or professional in a given field. | [![Chat app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/k1XhccNDT94/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/k1XhccNDT94) |
| **🧠 Memory Prompts** | Analyze conversations and extract specific information based on predefined criteria. | Use for summarization, key point extraction, or identifying action items from discussions. | [![Memory app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Y3ehX_ueQmE/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/Y3ehX_ueQmE) |

### [​](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/Introduction\#2-integration-apps:-connecting-omi-to-external-systems)  2\. Integration Apps: Connecting OMI to External Systems

These apps allow OMI to interact with external services and process data in real-time:

| App Type | Description | Use Cases | Example Video |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **👷 Memory Creation Triggers** | Activated when OMI creates a new memory | \- Update project management tools with conversation summaries<br>\- Create a personalized social platform that matches you with like-minded individuals based on your conversations and interests<br>\- Generate a comprehensive knowledge graph of your interests, experiences, and relationships over time | [![Memory trigger app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Yv7gP3GZ0ME/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/Yv7gP3GZ0ME) |  |  |  |
| **🏎️ Real-Time Transcript Processors** | Process conversation transcripts as they occur | \- Live conversation coaching, providing feedback on communication skills and suggesting improvements in real-time<br>\- Handling trigger phrases like “Hey Omi, remind me to…” to set reminders or “Hey Omi, add to cart…” to update your shopping lists<br>\- Performing real-time web searches or fact-checking during conversations<br>\- Analyzing emotional states and providing supportive responses or suggestions<br>\- Integrating with smart home systems to control devices based on conversational cues | [![Memory trigger app](https://img.youtube.com/vi/h4ojO3WzkxQ/0.jpg)](https://youtube.com/shorts/h4ojO3WzkxQ) |  |  |  |
| **🔄 Integration Actions** | Perform actions within the OMI ecosystem | \- Create memories from external data sources<br>\- Generate memories from emails, messages, or social media posts<br>\- Import conversation transcripts from other platforms<br>\- Schedule periodic memory creation for journaling or logging<br>\- Sync data between OMI and external services | [Learn more](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/apps/IntegrationActions) |  |  |  |
| **Real-time Audio Streaming** | Processes raw audio real-time | [Read more here](https://docs.omi.me/doc/developer/AudioStreaming) |  |  |  |  |
