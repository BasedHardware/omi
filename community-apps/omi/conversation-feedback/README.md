# Conversation Feedback

Get actionable, AI-powered feedback after your conversations to continuously improve your communication skills.

## Features

- **Smart Notifications**: Only notifies you when there's truly important feedback
- **Concise Insights**: Maximum 20-word feedback focused on key takeaways
- **Human-like Tone**: Friendly, casual, and conversational feedback style
- **GPT-4 Powered**: Uses advanced AI to analyze conversation quality and extract insights

## How It Works

1. **Trigger**: Automatically runs when a conversation finishes and memory is created
2. **Analysis**: GPT-4 analyzes the full transcript and structured conversation data
3. **Filtering**: Determines if feedback is important enough to notify a busy user
4. **Delivery**: Sends concise, actionable feedback directly to your Omi app

## Example Feedback

> "nice empathy when she mentioned stress. next time ask more follow-up questions to deepen the connection"

> "you dominated the conversation - try pausing more to let them share"

> "great active listening! you summarized their points perfectly"
