Connect to the device via serial monitor (921600 baud) and use these commands:

#### **Quick Status Check**
```
status
```
Shows current battery level, connection status, and device state.

#### **Charging Status Monitor**
```
charging
```
Takes 10 readings over 20 seconds and shows charging status:
- üîã **CHARGING** (>4.1V) - Actively charging
- ‚ö° **CHARGED** (3.9-4.1V) - Good charge level
- üî¥ **LOW** (3.7-3.9V) - Needs charging
- ‚ùå **CRITICAL** (<3.7V) - Check connections

#### **Battery Runtime Calculator**
```
runtime
```
Shows how long your glasses will last with current charge level for different usage scenarios.

#### **Charging Time Calculator**
```
chargetime
```
Calculates estimated time to reach 80%, 90%, and 100% charge based on current level.

#### **Continuous Monitor**
```
monitor
```
Continuous 5-second interval monitoring. Type any command to stop.

### **OMI App Battery Display**
The OMI app automatically shows battery percentage when connected to the glasses.

| **3.7V - 3.8V** | 0-20% | Low battery | 60-90 minutes |
| **3.5V - 3.7V** | Critical | Very low | 90+ minutes |
| **<3.5V** | Critical | Unsafe | Check hardware |

**Note**: Times are for 500mAh total capacity (2 x 250mAh) at typical Mac USB rates.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Battery Life Estimates (500mAh Total)

### **Expected Runtime on Full Charge**

| **Usage Pattern** | **Runtime** | **Description** |
|-------------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **üî• Heavy Use** | **6-7 hours** | Continuous photo capture, always active |
| **‚ö° Normal Use** | **8-10 hours** | Mixed usage: 60% active, 30% standby, 10% sleep |
| **üí§ Light Use** | **12-15 hours** | Mostly connected but idle, occasional photos |

### **Current Consumption Breakdown**
- **Active Mode**: ~80mA (Camera + BLE + processing)
- **Standby Mode**: ~40mA (BLE connected, camera off)
- **Sleep Mode**: ~2mA (Deep sleep, button wake-up)

### **Real-World Usage Examples**

#### **All-Day Meeting Recording** (8 hours)
- 30-second photo intervals
- Continuous BLE connection
- **Expected result**: 8-10 hours runtime ‚úÖ

#### **Occasional Use** (throughout day)
- Photos every few minutes
- Connected but mostly idle
- **Expected result**: 12-15 hours runtime ‚úÖ

#### **Intensive Documentation** (non-stop)
- Continuous photo capture
- High processing load
- **Expected result**: 6-7 hours runtime ‚ö†Ô∏è

## üîå Charging Verification Steps

### **Step 1: Connect & Check Initial Reading**
```
status
```
Note the starting voltage (should be <4.1V if not charged).

### **Step 2: Connect Charger**
1. Plug in USB-C charger
2. Check for charging LED (red light)
3. Wait 5 minutes for voltage to stabilize

### **Step 3: Monitor Charging Progress**
```
charging
```
You should see:
- **Voltage increasing** over time
- **Status showing "CHARGING"** when >4.1V
- **Steady upward trend** in readings

### **Step 4: Verify Full Charge**
After 2-3 hours:
```
status
```
Should show:
- **Voltage: 4.2V-4.3V**
- **Battery: 100%**
- **Green charging LED**

## üîß Hardware Verification

### **Battery Connection Check**
The firmware monitors battery via:
- **Pin**: GPIO2 (A1) with voltage divider
- **Voltage divider**: 169kŒ©/110kŒ© resistors (1.862 ratio)
- **Expected ADC range**: 1.4V-2.3V (at GPIO2)

### **Connection Troubleshooting**

#### **Problem**: Always shows 0% or 100%
**Solution**: Check voltage divider connections
```
status
```
Look for unrealistic voltages (<2V or >5V)

#### **Problem**: Voltage doesn't change during charging
**Solution**: 
1. Verify charger is connected
2. Check charging LED on ESP32-S3
3. Try different USB cable/charger
4. Check battery connections

#### **Problem**: Shows "CRITICAL" with charger connected
**Solution**:
1. Check voltage divider wiring
2. Ensure A1 (GPIO2) is connected correctly
3. Verify resistor values (169kŒ© and 110kŒ©)

## ‚ö° Charging Best Practices

### **Optimal Charging**
- **Charge when battery drops below 20%** (3.8V)
- **Don't let battery go below 3.5V** (damages Li-ion cells)
- **Charge in moderate temperatures** (10¬∞C-40¬∞C)
- **Use quality USB-C charger** (5V, 1A minimum)

### **Battery Life Optimization**
- **Avoid complete discharge** (stop using at 3.7V)
- **Charge regularly** (don't leave dead for days)
- **Store at 50% charge** if not using for weeks
- **Optimize usage patterns** for longer runtime:
  - Use light sleep mode when possible
  - Reduce photo frequency for all-day use
  - Disconnect when not needed to save power

### **Status Monitoring Schedule**
- **Before use**: Quick `status` check
- **During long sessions**: Periodic `status` checks
- **While charging**: Use `charging` command to verify progress
- **For troubleshooting**: Use `monitor` for continuous tracking

## üÜò Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| **Issue** | **Command** | **Expected Result** | **Fix** |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| Won't charge | `charging` | Voltage increases | Check charger/cable |
| Shows 0% always | `status` | Voltage <2V | Check hardware connections |
| Won't turn on | `monitor` | No response | Charge for 30+ minutes |
| Inconsistent readings | `charging` | Fluctuating values | Check loose connections |
| App shows wrong % | `status` | Compare readings | Reconnect BLE |

**For hardware issues**: Check the voltage divider circuit and ensure GPIO2 (A1) is properly connected to the battery voltage divider midpoint.
