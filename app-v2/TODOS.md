# TODOS — app-v2

Deferred work captured during planning. Add to a sprint when picking up.

## Bound `home.actions.v1` retention to 90 days

**What:** On `main()` boot, compact the `home.actions.v1` Hive box by deleting rows whose `ts` is older than 90 days.

**Why:** The action log accumulates a row per dismiss / snooze / tap-through / open / accept. Over months of dogfood, thousands of rows. Unbounded local growth has no functional value beyond ~30–60 days; older rows aren't read by any generator's dedup check.

**Pros:**
- Keeps Hive open-box latency bounded at cold start.
- Trivial implementation (~5 lines): iterate keys, delete where `now - ts > 90d`.
- Invisible to the user.

**Cons:**
- Tiny scope creep on whichever sprint picks it up.
- Loses ability to do retention analytics from prior 90+ days (but no current analysis depends on that).

**Context:** Surfaced during `/plan-eng-review` of the Companion Stream Home design (2026-04-30). The full design doc is at `~/.gstack/projects/togodynamicslab-omi/matheusoliviera-main-design-20260430-111632.md` — see "Performance notes" section.

**Depends on:** Sprint 0 having shipped (`home.actions.v1` Hive box must exist). After that, do anytime.
